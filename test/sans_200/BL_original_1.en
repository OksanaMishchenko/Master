5 haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
6 ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
gonal-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products , in the same injection , except lutropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity , stability , pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotropins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant fsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
7 use during lactation
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4.4 .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophins , atc code :
gonal-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells .
in women , the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of fsh is the development of mature graafian follicles .
in clinical trials , patients with severe fsh and lh deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l as measured in a central laboratory .
however , it should be taken into account that there are variations between lh measurements performed in different laboratories .
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis .
pharmacokinetic properties
the steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l / h , respectively .
one- eighth of the gonal-f dose is excreted in the urine .
following subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 .
following repeated administration , gonal-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days .
in women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed , gonal-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis , despite unmeasurable lh levels .
preclinical safety data
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this spc .
impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa ( 40 iu / kg / day ) for extended periods , through reduced fecundity .
9 given in high doses ( 5 iu / kg / day ) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen , and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hmg .
however , since gonal-f is not indicated in pregnancy , these data are of limited clinical relevance .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
anovulation ( including polycystic ovarian disease , pcod ) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f in association with a luteinising hormone ( lh ) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe lh and fsh deficiency .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .
posology and method of administration
treatment with gonal-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems .
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous administration .
the powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided .
in order to avoid the injection of large volumes , up to 3 containers of product may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent .
the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration , and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary fsh-containing preparations .
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .
in menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and / or oestrogen secretion .
a commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 iu , or 75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5 000 iu , up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
13 women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5 iu-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5,000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
in men : primary testicular insufficiency
special warnings and precautions for use
gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and with access to expert advice .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to what can be obtained with hmg .
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia ,
15 haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
16 reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
gonal-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products , in the same injection , except lutropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity , stability , pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy

gonal-f in association with a luteinising hormone ( lh ) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe lh and fsh deficiency .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .
posology and method of administration
treatment with gonal-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems .
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous administration .
the powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided .
in order to avoid the injection of large volumes , up to 3 vials of product may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent .
22 the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration , and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary fsh-containing preparations .
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .
in menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and / or oestrogen secretion .
a commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5 000 iu , up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
23 women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5,000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
gonal-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained , such as :
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
special warnings and precautions for use
gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and with access to expert advice .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to what can be obtained with hmg .
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia ,
25 haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
26 reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
use during lactation
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
27 within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4.4 .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophins , atc code :
gonal-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells .
in women , the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of fsh is the development of mature graafian follicles .
in clinical trials , patients with severe fsh and lh deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l as measured in a central laboratory .
however , it should be taken into account that there are variations between lh measurements performed in different laboratories .
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis .
pharmacokinetic properties
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day .
the steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l / h , respectively .
one- eighth of the gonal-f dose is excreted in the urine .
following subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 .
following repeated administration , gonal-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days .
in women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed , gonal-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis , despite unmeasurable lh levels .
preclinical safety data
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this spc ..
impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa ( 40 iu / kg / day ) for extended periods , through reduced fecundity .
given in high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen , and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hmg .
however , since gonal-f is not indicated in pregnancy , these data are of limited clinical relevance .

ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
35 the following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of ohss : abdominal pain , abdominal distension , severe ovarian enlargement , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia , haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .

women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
use during lactation
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
37 no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .

overdose
38 the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4.4 .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophins , atc code :
gonal-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells .
in women , the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of fsh is the development of mature graafian follicles .
in clinical trials , patients with severe fsh and lh deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l as measured in a central laboratory .
however , it should be taken into account that there are variations between lh measurements performed in different laboratories .
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis .
pharmacokinetic properties
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day .
the steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l / h , respectively .
one- eighth of the gonal-f dose is excreted in the urine .
following subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 .
following repeated administration , gonal-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days .
in women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed , gonal-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis , despite unmeasurable lh levels .
preclinical safety data
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this spc .
impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa ( 40 iu / kg / day ) for extended periods , through reduced fecundity .
given in high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen , and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hmg .
however , since gonal-f is not indicated in pregnancy , these data are of limited clinical relevance .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
anovulation ( including polycystic ovarian disease , pcod ) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .
posology and method of administration
treatment with gonal-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems .
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous administration .
the powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided .
in order to avoid the injection of large volumes , gonal-f 37.5 iu ( 2.8 micrograms ) may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent and combined with gonal-f 75 iu ( 5.5 micrograms ) and / or gonal-f 150 iu ( 11 micrograms ) .
up to three vials of product may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent .
42 the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration , and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary fsh-containing preparations .
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .
in menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and / or oestrogen secretion .
a commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5 000 iu , up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
43 women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5,000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
gonal-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained , such as :
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
special warnings and precautions for use
gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and with access to expert advice .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to what can be obtained with hmg .
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia ,
45 haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
46 reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
anovulation ( including polycystic ovarian disease , pcod ) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f in association with a luteinising hormone ( lh ) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe lh and fsh deficiency .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .

52 the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration , and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary fsh-containing preparations .
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of gonal-f .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .

if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5 000 iu , up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
53 women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5,000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
gonal-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained , such as :
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
special warnings and precautions for use
gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and with access to expert advice .
during training of the patient for self- administration , special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the multidose presentation .
as gonal-f multidose is intended for several injections , clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation .
due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to what can be obtained with hmg .
55 ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
the following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of ohss : abdominal pain , abdominal distension , severe ovarian enlargement , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia , haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
56 pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
gonal-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
57 use during lactation
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4.4 .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophins , atc code :
gonal-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells .
in women , the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of fsh is the development of mature graafian follicles .
in clinical trials , patients with severe fsh and lh deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l as measured in a central laboratory .
however , it should be taken into account that there are variations between lh measurements performed in different laboratories .
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis .
pharmacokinetic properties
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day .
the steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l / h , respectively .
one- eighth of the gonal-f dose is excreted in the urine .
following subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 .
following repeated administration , gonal-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days .
in women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed , gonal-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis , despite unmeasurable lh levels .
preclinical safety data
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this spc .
59 in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with 0.9 benzyl alcohol and 0.9 benzyl alcohol alone , both resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively .
impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa ( 40 iu / kg / day ) for extended periods , through reduced fecundity .
given in high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen , and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hmg .
however , since gonal-f is not indicated in pregnancy , these data are of limited clinical relevance .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
anovulation ( including polycystic ovarian disease , pcod ) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f in association with a luteinising hormone ( lh ) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe lh and fsh deficiency .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .
posology and method of administration
treatment with gonal-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems .
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous administration .
the powder should be reconstituted prior to the first use with the solvent provided .
gonal-f 450 iu / 0.75 ml ( 33 micrograms / 0.75 ml ) preparation must not be reconstituted with any other gonal-f containers .
the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration , and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary fsh-containing preparations .
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of gonal-f .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .
in menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and / or oestrogen secretion .
a commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5 000 iu , up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5,000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
in men : primary testicular insufficiency
special warnings and precautions for use
gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and with access to expert advice .
during training of the patient for self- administration , special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the multidose presentation .
as gonal-f multidose is intended for several injections , clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation .
due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to what can be obtained with hmg .
65 ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
the following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of ohss : abdominal pain , abdominal distension , severe ovarian enlargement , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia , haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .

the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
gonal-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
67 use during lactation
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4.4 .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophins , atc code :
gonal-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells .
in women , the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of fsh is the development of mature graafian follicles .
in clinical trials , patients with severe fsh and lh deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l as measured in a central laboratory .
however , it should be taken into account that there are variations between lh measurements performed in different laboratories .
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis .
pharmacokinetic properties
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day .
the steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l / h , respectively .
one- eighth of the gonal-f dose is excreted in the urine .
following subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 .
following repeated administration , gonal-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days .
in women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed , gonal-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis , despite unmeasurable lh levels .
preclinical safety data
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this spc .
69 in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with 0.9 benzyl alcohol and 0.9 benzyl alcohol alone , both resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively .
impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa ( 40 iu / kg / day ) for extended periods , through reduced fecundity .
given in high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen , and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hmg .
however , since gonal-f is not indicated in pregnancy , these data are of limited clinical relevance .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
anovulation ( including polycystic ovarian disease , pcod ) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f in association with a luteinising hormone ( lh ) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe lh and fsh deficiency .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .
posology and method of administration
treatment with gonal-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems .
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous administration .
the powder should be reconstituted prior to the first use with the solvent provided .
gonal-f 300 iu / 0.50 ml ( 22 micrograms / 0.50 ml ) preparation must not be reconstituted with any other gonal-f containers .
the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration , and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary fsh-containing preparations .
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of gonal-f .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .
in menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and / or oestrogen secretion .
a commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5 000 iu , up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5,000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
in men : primary testicular insufficiency
special warnings and precautions for use
74 gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and with access to expert advice .
during training of the patient for self- administration , special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the multidose presentation .
as gonal-f multidose is intended for several injections , clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation .
due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to what can be obtained with hmg .
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
75 serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
the following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of ohss : abdominal pain , abdominal distension , severe ovarian enlargement , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia , haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
76 ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
gonal-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection .
pregnancy and lactation
use during pregnancy
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
anovulation ( including polycystic ovarian disease , pcod ) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f in association with a luteinising hormone ( lh ) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe lh and fsh deficiency .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .
posology and method of administration
treatment with gonal-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems .
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous administration .
the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary fsh-containing
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of gonal-f .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .
in menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and / or oestrogen secretion .
a commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5 000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5 000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5 000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
special warnings and precautions for use
gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
84 gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and have access to expert advice .
during training of the patient for self- administration , special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the prefilled pen .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or for art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to the recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
for accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation , the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to that obtained with hmg .
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
the following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of ohss : abdominal pain , abdominal distension , severe ovarian enlargement , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia , haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
85 excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
86 reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur ( see section 4.4 ) .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophins , atc code :
gonal-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells .
in women , the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of fsh is the development of mature graafian follicles .
in clinical trials , patients with severe fsh and lh deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l as measured in a central laboratory .
however , it should be taken into account that there are variations between lh measurements performed in different laboratories .
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis .
pharmacokinetic properties
following intravenous administration , follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day .
the steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l / h , respectively .
one-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine .
following subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 .
following repeated administration , follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days .
in women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed , follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis , despite unmeasurable lh levels .
preclinical safety data
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this spc .
impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa ( 40 iu / kg / day ) for extended periods , through reduced fecundity .
given in high doses ( 5 iu / kg / day ) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen , and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hmg .
however , since gonal-f is not indicated in pregnancy , these data are of limited clinical relevance .

ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
the following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of ohss : abdominal pain , abdominal distension , severe ovarian enlargement , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia , haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
94 excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .
ectopic pregnancy
women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
reproductive system neoplasms
95 there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .
thromboembolic events
in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
97 pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophins , atc code :
gonal-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary ( cho ) cells .
in women , the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of fsh is the development of mature graafian follicles .
in clinical trials , patients with severe fsh and lh deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l as measured in a central laboratory .
however , it should be taken into account that there are variations between lh measurements performed in different laboratories .
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis .
pharmacokinetic properties
following intravenous administration , follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day .
the steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l / h , respectively .
one-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine .
following subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 .
following repeated administration , follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days .
in women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed , follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis , despite unmeasurable lh levels .
preclinical safety data
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this spc .
impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa ( 40 iu / kg / day ) for extended periods , through reduced fecundity .
given in high doses ( 5 iu / kg / day ) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen , and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hmg .
however , since gonal-f is not indicated in pregnancy , these data are of limited clinical relevance .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
anovulation ( including polycystic ovarian disease , pcod ) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f in association with a luteinising hormone ( lh ) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe lh and fsh deficiency .
in clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum lh level &lt; 1.2 iu / l .
gonal-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) therapy .
posology and method of administration
treatment with gonal-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems .
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous administration .
the dosage recommendations given for gonal-f are those in use for urinary fsh .
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that its daily doses , regimens of administration and treatment
however , when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions .
bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of gonal-f .
it is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below .
women with anovulation ( including pcod ) :
the object of gonal-f therapy is to develop a single mature graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hcg .
gonal-f may be given as a course of daily injections .
in menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and / or oestrogen secretion .
a commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5 000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies :
a commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle .
in general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5 000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce final follicular maturation .
down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous lh surge and to control tonic levels of lh .
in a commonly used protocol , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
overall experience with ivf indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter .
women with anovulation resulting from severe lh and fsh deficiency :
gonal-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa .
since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion , treatment can commence at any time .
treatment should be tailored to the individual patient &apos;s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response .
a recommended regimen commences at 75 iu of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 iu fsh .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 iu increments .
it may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5 000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg should be administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f and lutropin alfa injections .
the patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of , and on the day following , hcg administration .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld .
treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of fsh lower than that of the previous cycle .
men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism :
gonal-f should be given at a dosage of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , for a minimum of 4 months .
if after this period , the patient has not responded , the combination treatment may be continued ; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis .
contraindications
in women : primary ovarian failure malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
special warnings and precautions for use
102 gonal-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions , and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management .
gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals , as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities .
in women , safe and effective use of gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound , alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels , on a regular basis .
there may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to fsh administration , with a poor response to fsh in some patients .
the lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women .
self-administration of gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated , adequately trained and have access to expert advice .
during training of the patient for self- administration , special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the prefilled pen .
the first injection of gonal-f should be performed under direct medical supervision .
patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f .
deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment .
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
treatment in women
before starting treatment , the couple &apos;s infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated .
in particular , patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism , adrenocortical deficiency , hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours , and appropriate specific treatment given .
patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth , whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or for art procedures , may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation .
adherence to the recommended gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration , and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events .
for accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation , the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests .
in clinical trials , an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to gonal-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa .
if an fsh dose increase is deemed appropriate , dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 iu increments .
no direct comparison of gonal-f / lh versus human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hmg ) has been performed .
comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is similar to that obtained with hmg .
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss )
ohss is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement .
ohss is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity .
it comprises marked ovarian enlargement , high serum sex steroids , and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal , pleural and , rarely , in the pericardial cavities .
clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia ,
103 haemoconcentration , electrolyte imbalances , ascites , haemoperitoneum , pleural effusions , hydrothorax , acute pulmonary distress , and thromboembolic events .
very rarely , severe ohss may be complicated by pulmonary embolism , ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction .
excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to ohss unless hcg is administered to trigger ovulation .
therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hcg and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days .
ohss may progress rapidly ( within 24 hours to several days ) to become a serious medical event , therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hcg administration .
to minimise the risk of ohss or of multiple pregnancy , ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended .
in anovulation the risk of ohss and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter .
in art there is an increased risk of ohss with a serum oestradiol &gt; 3000 pg / ml ( 11000 pmol / l ) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter .
when the oestradiol level is &gt; 5500 pg / ml ( 20200 pmol / l ) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total , it may be necessary to withhold hcg administration .
adherence to recommended gonal-f dosage , regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
in art , aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation .
ohss may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs .
most often , ohss occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment .
usually , ohss resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses .
if severe ohss occurs , gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing , the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for ohss started .
this syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease .
multiple pregnancy
multiple pregnancy , specially high order , carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes .
in patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonal-f , the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception .
the majority of multiple conceptions are twins .
to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy , careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended .
in patients undergoing art procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced , their quality and the patient age .
the patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment .
pregnancy wastage
the incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or art than in the normal population .

women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy , whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments .
the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ivf was reported to be 2 to 5 , as compared to 1 to 1.5 in the general population .
104 reproductive system neoplasms
there have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms , both benign and malignant , in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment .
it is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women .
congenital malformation
the prevalence of congenital malformations after art may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions .
this is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics ( e. g. maternal age , sperm characteristics ) and multiple pregnancies .

in women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events , such as personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk .
in these women , the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks .
it should be noted however , that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events .
treatment in men
elevated endogenous fsh levels are indicative of primary testicular failure .
such patients are unresponsive to gonal-f / hcg therapy .
semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
there is no indication for use of gonal-f during pregnancy .
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , in clinical use with gonadotrophins .
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh .
however , to date , no particular malformative effect has been reported .
no teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies .
gonal-f is not indicated during lactation .
during lactation , the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation .

information for the user

read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine .
you may need to read it again .
- if you have any further questions , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
- this medicine has been prescribed for you .

if their symptoms are the same as yours .
- if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet ,
please tell you doctor or pharmacist .

before you use gonal-f 3 .
how to use gonal-f 4 .
possible side effects 5 .
how to store gonal-f 6 .
further information
what gonal-f is and what it is used for
gonal-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa , which is made in laboratories by special recombinant dna techniques .
it belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins , which are involved in the normal control of reproduction .
therapeutic indications
the medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician .
in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate , gonal-f can be used to cause ovulation .
gonal-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles ( and therefore several eggs ) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation , gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer .
gonal-f is used in combination with another medicine , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) , to produce sperm in men , who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency .
before you use gonal-f
you and your partner &apos;s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started .
161 do not use gonal-f
if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of gonal-f. if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
if you are a woman :
ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause ovarian , uterine or breast cancer
the medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as premature menopause , malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb .
if you are a man :
gonal-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage .
in addition , no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
take special care with gonal-f
if you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria ( a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children ) , you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness .
if you are a woman , this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) ( see section 4 ) .
however , if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to , the occurrence of ohss is uncommon .
gonal-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant ohss unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation ( containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hcg ) is administered .
it is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hcg in cases where ohss is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days .
the risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes / embryos replaced .
in patients undergoing induction of ovulation , the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception .
however , this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration .
miscarriages are higher than in the normal population , but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems .
there have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to gonal-f .
if you had this type of reaction to similar medicines , inform your doctor .
if you are a man , elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage .
gonal-f is usually not effective in such cases .
to monitor the treatment , your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment .
using other medicines
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
162 gonal-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection , except for lutropin alfa .
studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together , without either product being adversely affected .
pregnancy and breast-feeding
gonal-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding .
important information about some of the ingredients of gonal-f
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
how to use gonal-f
always take gonal-f exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all .
gonal-f is usually given every day .
if you have periods , the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
a commonly used dose starts at 75-150 iu fsh every day .
this may be increased by 37.5 iu-75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment , that treatment cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of another medicine ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies .
a commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle .
treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved ( as assessed by blood monitoring and / or ultrasound examination ) , with the dose adjusted according to your response , to usually not higher than 450 iu daily .
adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
in these cases , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
163 women who are not ovulating , having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as fsh and lh deficient .
your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment .
gonal-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa .
a commonly used dose starts with 75-150 iu of gonal-f together with 75 iu of lutropin alfa .
according to your response , your doctor may increase your dose of gonal-f by preferably 37.5-75 iu at 7 to 14-day intervals .
if your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of gonal-f than in the abandoned cycle .
when the desired response has been obtained , a single injection of hcg is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of gonal-f and lutropin alfa .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of , and the day following , administration of the hcg .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe gonal-f at as lower dose than that of the previous cycle .
infertile men with hormonal deficiency .
gonal-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 iu three times a week in combination with another medicine ( hcg ) for at least 4 months .
if you have not responded to treatment after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months .
route of administration
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous use , that means given by injection just under the skin .
it is for single use only .
if you administer gonal-f to yourself , please carefully read the following instructions :
wash your hands .
it is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible .
assemble and lay out on a clean surface everything you need :
one ampoule containing gonal-f powder one solvent ampoule two alcohol swabs one syringe one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
open the ampoule of solvent ( clear liquid ) :
on the head of the solvent ampoule , you will see a
164 small coloured dot .
directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it easier to break .
gently flick the top section of the ampoule so that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the bottom chamber .
now press the ampoule firmly over the neck , and break the ampoule away from the coloured dot .
carefully place the open ampoule upright on the work surface .
draw up the solvent :
attach the needle for reconstitution to the syringe , with the syringe in one hand , pick up the open ampoule , insert the needle and draw up all of the solvent .
carefully set the syringe down on the work surface , taking care not to touch the needle .
open and prepare the injection solution :
open the ampoule containing the gonal-f powder , pick up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the ampoule of powder .
after the powder has dissolved ( which usually occurs immediately ) , gently draw the solution back into the syringe .
( if you have been prescribed more than one ampoule of gonal-f , slowly re-inject the solution into another powder ampoule , until you have the prescribed number of powder ampoules dissolved in the solution .
if you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to gonal-f , you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately .
after dissolving the lutropin alfa powder , draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the ampoule containing gonal-f .
once the powder has dissolved , draw the solution back into the syringe .
inspect for particles as before , and do not use if the solution is not clear .
up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in the content of one ampoule of solvent . )
push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone .
immediately inject the solution :
your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject ( e. g. tummy , front of thigh ) .
wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab .
firmly pinch the
skin together and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 angle using a dart-like motion .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger .
take as much time as you need to inject all the solution .
immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion .
dispose of all used items :
once you have finished your injection , immediately discard all needles and empty ampoules in the sharp container provided .
any unused solution must be discarded .
if you use more gonal-f than you should
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4 .
however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see section 2 ) .
if you forget to take gonal-f
do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , please contact your doctor .
possible side effects
like all medicines , gonal-f can cause side effects , although not every body gets them .
side effects in women the most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts , headache and local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see section 2 ) can occur .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
in rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome .
in view of the above , to prevent such events , when the ovarian response is excessive , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
rarely abnormal blood clottings ( blood clots in blood vessels ) have been seen to occur with similar medicines , so this could possibly occur with gonal-f / hcg therapy or gonal-f / lutropin alfa / hcg therapy .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
166 ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

further information
what gonal-f is and what it is used for
gonal-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa , which is made in laboratories by special recombinant dna techniques .
it belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins , which are involved in the normal control of reproduction .
therapeutic indications
the medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician .
in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate , gonal-f can be used to cause ovulation .
gonal-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles ( and therefore several eggs ) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation , gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer .
gonal-f is used in combination with another medicine , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) , to produce sperm in men , who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency .
before you use gonal-f
you and your partner &apos;s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started .
171 do not use gonal-f
if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of gonal-f. if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
if you are a woman :
ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause ovarian , uterine or breast cancer
the medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as premature menopause , malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb .
if you are a man :
gonal-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage .
in addition , no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
take special care with gonal-f
if you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria ( a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children ) , you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness .
if you are a woman , this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) ( see section 4 ) .

if you had this type of reaction to similar medicines , inform your doctor .
if you are a man , elevated follicule stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage .
gonal-f is usually not effective in such cases .
to monitor the treatment , your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment .
using other medicines
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
182 gonal-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection , except for lutropin alfa .
studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together , without either product being adversely affected .
pregnancy and breast-feeding
gonal-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding .
important information about some of the ingredients of gonal-f
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
how to use gonal-f
always take gonal-f exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all .
gonal-f is usually given every day .
if you have periods , the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
a commonly used dose starts at 75-150 iu fsh every day .
this may be increased by 37.5-75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment , that treatment cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of another medicine ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies .
a commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle .
treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved ( as assessed by blood monitoring and / or ultrasound examination ) , with the dose adjusted according to your response , to usually not higher than 450 iu daily .
adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
in these cases , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
183 women who are not ovulating , having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as fsh and lh deficient .
your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment .
gonal-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa .
a commonly used dose starts with 75-150 iu of gonal-f together with 75 iu of lutropin alfa .
according to your response , your doctor may increase your dose of gonal-f by preferably 37.5-75 iu at 7 to 14-day intervals .
if your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of gonal-f than in the abandoned cycle .
when the desired response has been obtained , a single injection of hcg is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of gonal-f and lutropin alfa .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of , and the day following , administration of the hcg .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe gonal-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle .
infertile men with hormonal deficiency .
gonal-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 iu three times a week in combination with another medicine ( hcg ) for at least 4 months .
if you have not responded to treatment after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months .
route of administration
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous use , that means given by injection just under the skin .
it is for single use only .
if you administer gonal-f to yourself , please carefully read the following instructions :
wash your hands .
it is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible .
- - - - - -
one vial containing gonal-f powder one solvent vial two alcohol swabs one syringe one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
184 remove the protective cap from the solvent vial .
attach the reconstitution needle to the syringe and draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to approximately the 1 ml mark .
then , insert the needle into the vial , push the plunger to expel the air , turn the vial upside down and gently draw up all the solvent .
set the syringe down carefully on the work-surface taking care not to touch the needle .
prepare the injection solution :
remove the protective cap from the gonal-f powder vial , pick up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the vial of powder .
do not shake .
after the powder has dissolved ( which usually occurs immediately ) , check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles .
turn the vial upside down , gently draw the solution back into the syringe .
( if you have been prescribed more than one vial of gonal-f , slowly re-inject the solution into another powder vial , until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution .
if you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to gonal-f , you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately .
after dissolving the lutropin alfa powder , draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing gonal-f .
once the powder has dissolved , draw the solution back into the syringe .
inspect for particles as before , and do not use if the solution is not clear .
up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent . )
change the needle for the fine bore needle and remove any air bubbles :
if you see air bubbles in the syringe , hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top .
push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone .
immediately inject the solution :
your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject ( e. g. tummy , front of thigh ) .
wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab .
firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 angle using a dart-like motion .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger .
take as much time as you need to inject all the solution .
immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion .
dispose of all used items :
once you have finished your injection , immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in the sharp container provided .
any unused solution must be discarded .
if you use more gonal-f than you should
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4 .
however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see section 2 ) .
185 if you forget to take gonal-f
do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , please contact your doctor .
possible side effects
like all medicines , gonal-f can cause side effects , although not every body gets them .
side effects in women the most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts , headache and local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see section 2 ) can occur .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
in rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome .
in view of the above , to prevent such events , when the ovarian response is excessive , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
rarely abnormal blood clottings ( blood clots in blood vessels ) have been seen to occur with similar medicines , so this could possibly occur with gonal-f / hcg therapy or gonal-f / lutropin alfa / hcg therapy .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

further information
what gonal-f is and what it is used for
gonal-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa , which is made in laboratories by special recombinant dna techniques .
it belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins , which are involved in the normal control of reproduction .
therapeutic indications
the medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician .
in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate , gonal-f can be used to cause ovulation .
gonal-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles ( and therefore several eggs ) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation , gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer .
gonal-f is used in combination with another medicine , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) , to produce sperm in men , who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency .
before you use gonal-f
you and your partner &apos;s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started .
190 do not use gonal-f
if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of gonal-f. if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
if you are a woman :
ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause ovarian , uterine or breast cancer
the medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as premature menopause , malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb .
if you are a man :
gonal-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage .
in addition , no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
take special care with gonal-f
if you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria ( a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children ) , you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness .
if you are a woman , this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) ( see section 4 ) .
however , if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to , the occurrence of ohss is uncommon .
gonal-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant ohss unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation ( containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hcg ) is administered .
it is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hcg in cases where ohss is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days .
the risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes / embryos replaced .
in patients undergoing induction of ovulation , the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception .
however , this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration .
miscarriages are higher than in the normal population , but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems .
there have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to gonal-f .
if you had this type of reaction to similar medicines , inform your doctor .
if you are a man , elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage .
gonal-f is usually not effective in such cases .

200 gonal-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection , except for lutropin alfa .
studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together , without either product being adversely affected .
pregnancy and breast-feeding
gonal-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding .
important information about some of the ingredients of gonal-f
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
how to use gonal-f
always take gonal-f exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all .
gonal-f is usually given every day .
if you have periods , the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
a commonly used dose starts at 75-150 iu fsh every day .
this may be increased by 37.5-75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh .
if your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment , that treatment cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of another medicine ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies .
a commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle .
treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved ( as assessed by blood monitoring and / or ultrasound examination ) , with the dose adjusted according to your response , to usually not higher than 450 iu daily .
adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
in these cases , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
201 women who are not ovulating , having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as fsh and lh deficient .
your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment .
gonal-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa .
a commonly used dose starts with 75-150 iu of gonal-f together with 75 iu of lutropin alfa .
according to your response , your doctor may increase your dose of gonal-f by preferably 37.5-75 iu at 7 to 14-day intervals .
if your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of gonal-f than in the abandoned cycle .
when the desired response has been obtained , a single injection of hcg is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of gonal-f and lutropin alfa .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of , and the day following , administration of the hcg .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe gonal-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle .
infertile men with hormonal deficiency .
gonal-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 iu three times a week in combination with another medicine ( hcg ) for at least 4 months .
if you have not responded to treatment after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months .
route of administration
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous use , that means given by injection just under the skin .
it is for single use only .
if you administer gonal-f to yourself , please carefully read the following instructions :
wash your hands .
it is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible .
- - - - -
one vial containing gonal-f powder one pre-filled syringe containing the solvent two alcohol swabs one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
prepare the injection solution :
remove the protective caps from the gonal-f vial and from
202 the solvent pre-filled syringe .
attach the needle for reconstitution to the pre-filled syringe and slowly inject all the solvent into the vial of gonal-f powder .
do not shake .
after the powder has dissolved ( which usually occurs immediately ) , check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles .
turn the vial upside down , gently draw the solution back into the syringe .
( if you have been prescribed more than one vial of gonal-f , slowly re-inject the solution into another powder vial , until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution .
if you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to gonal-f , you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately .
after dissolving the lutropin alfa powder , draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing gonal-f .
once the powder has dissolved , draw the solution back into the syringe .
inspect for particles as before , and do not use if the solution is not clear .
up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent . )
change the needle for the fine bore needle and remove any air bubbles :
if you see air bubbles in the syringe , hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top .
push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone .
immediately inject the solution :
your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject ( e. g. tummy , front of thigh ) .
wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab .
firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 angle using a dart-like motion .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger .
take as much time as you need to inject all the solution .
immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion .
dispose of all used items :
once you have finished your injection , immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in the sharp container provided .
any unused solution must be discarded .
203 if you use more gonal-f than you should
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4 .
however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see section 2 ) .
if you forget to take gonal-f
do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , please contact your doctor .
possible side effects
like all medicines , gonal-f can cause side effects , although not every body gets them .
side effects in women the most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts , headache and local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see also section 2 ) can occur .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
in rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome .
in view of the above , to prevent such events , when the ovarian response is excessive , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
rarely abnormal blood clottings ( blood clots in blood vessels ) have been seen to occur with similar medicines , so this could possibly occur with gonal-f / hcg therapy or gonal-f / lutropin alfa / hcg therapy .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

further information
what gonal-f is and what it is used for
gonal-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa , which is made in laboratories by special recombinant dna techniques .
it belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins , which are involved in the normal control of reproduction .
therapeutic indications
the medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician .
in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate , gonal-f can be used to cause ovulation .
gonal-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles ( and therefore several eggs ) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation , gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer .
gonal-f is used in combination with another medicine , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) , to produce sperm in men , who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency .
before you use gonal-f
you and your partner &apos;s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started .
208 do not use gonal-f
if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of gonal-f . if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
if you are a woman :
ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause ovarian , uterine or breast cancer
the medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as premature menopause , malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb .
if you are a man :
gonal-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage .
in addition , no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
take special care with gonal-f
if you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria ( a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children ) , you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness .
if you are a woman , this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) ( see section 4 ) .
however , if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to , the occurrence of ohss is uncommon .
gonal-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant ohss unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation ( containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hcg ) is administered .
it is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hcg in cases where ohss is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days .
the risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes / embryos replaced .
in patients undergoing induction of ovulation , the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception .
however , this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration .
miscarriages are higher than in the normal population , but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems .
there have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to gonal-f .
if you had this type of reaction to similar medicines , inform your doctor .
if you are a man , elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage .
gonal-f is usually not effective in such cases .
to monitor the treatment , your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment .
using other medicines
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
209 gonal-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection , except for lutropin alfa .

always take gonal-f exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all .
gonal-f is usually given every day .
if you have periods , the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
a commonly used dose starts at 75-150 iu fsh every day ( 0.13-0.25 ml ) .
this may be increased by 37.5-75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh ( 0.38 ml ) .
if your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment , that treatment cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of another medicine ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies .
a commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu ( 0.25-0.38 ml ) of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle .
adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
in these cases , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
women who are not ovulating , having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as fsh and lh deficient .
your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment .
gonal-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa .
a commonly used dose starts with 75-150 iu ( 0.13-0.25 ml ) of gonal-f together with 75 iu of lutropin alfa .
according to your response , your doctor may increase your dose of gonal-f by preferably 37.5-75 iu at 7 to 14-day intervals .
if your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of gonal-f than in the abandoned cycle .
when the desired response has been obtained , a single injection of hcg is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of gonal-f and lutropin alfa .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of , and the day following , administration of the hcg .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe gonal-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle .
infertile men with hormonal deficiency .
gonal-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 iu ( 0.25 ml ) three times a week in combination with another medicine ( hcg ) for at least 4 months .
if you have not responded to treatment after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months .
route of administration
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous use , that means given by injection just under the skin .
if you administer gonal-f to yourself , please carefully read the following instructions :
individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only .
as this vial contains enough medication for several days of treatment , you need to make sure you only draw the amount of medication that was prescribed by your doctor .
the next injection should be done at the same time the next day .
your doctor has prescribed you a dose of gonal-f in iu .
you should use one of the 15 administration syringes graduated in fsh units provided .
wash your hands .
it is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible .
assemble everything you need :
find a clean area and lay out everything ( two alcohol swabs , the 2 ml solvent pre-filled syringe , the vial containing gonal-f and a syringe for administration ) .
see illustration .
prepare the injection solution :
you should have a 2 ml pre-filled syringe containing clear liquid ( the solvent ) and one vial containing gonal-f ( the white powder ) .
remove the protective caps from the gonal-f vial and from the solvent pre-filled syringe .
pick up your pre-filled syringe of solvent and slowly inject all the solvent ( 2 ml ) into the vial of gonal-f powder .
remove the syringe used for reconstitution from the vial and dispose of it .
this vial contains several doses of gonal-f .
you will have to keep this vial several days and only draw the dose prescribed every day .
take the syringe for administration , fill it with air to the correct dose .
shake gently the vial of gonal-f with the solvent .
insert the needle into the vial , turn the vial upside down , inject the air in the vial and draw the prescribed dose of gonal-f into the syringe for administration .
remove any air bubbles :
if you see air bubbles in the syringe , hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top .
push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone .
inject the solution :
your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject ( e. g. tummy , front of thigh ) .
wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab .
firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 angle using a dart-like motion .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger .
take as much time as you need to inject all the solution .
immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion .
dispose of all used items :
once you have finished your injection , immediately discard the syringes used safely , preferably in a sharp container .
for further injections with the reconstituted solution of gonal-f , repeat steps 4. to 7 .
the reconstituted solution is for your use alone and should not be administered to other patients .
if you use more gonal-f than you should
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4 .
however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see section 2 ) .
if you forget to take gonal-f
do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , please contact your doctor .
possible side effects
like all medicines , gonal-f can cause side effects , although not every body gets them .
side effects in women the most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts , headache and local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) .
due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see section 2 ) can occur .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
in rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome .
in view of the above , to prevent such events , when the ovarian response is excessive , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
rarely abnormal blood clottings ( blood clots in blood vessels ) have been seen to occur with similar medicines , so this could possibly occur with gonal-f / hcg therapy or gonal-f / lutropin alfa / hcg therapy .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

further information .
what gonal-f is and what it is used for
gonal-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa , which is made in laboratories by special recombinant dna techniques .
it belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins , which are involved in the normal control of reproduction .
therapeutic indications
the medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician .
in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate , gonal-f can be used to cause ovulation .
gonal-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles ( and therefore several eggs ) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation , gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer .
gonal-f is used in combination with another medicine , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) , to produce sperm in men , who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency .
before you use gonal-f
you and your partner &apos;s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started .
227 do not use gonal-f
if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of gonal-f. if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
if you are a woman :
ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause ovarian , uterine or breast cancer
the medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as premature menopause , malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb .
if you are a man :
gonal-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage .
in addition , no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
take special care with gonal-f
gonal-f multidose is intended for several injections .
if you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria ( a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children ) , you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness .
if you are a woman , this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) ( see section 4 ) .
however , if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to , the occurrence of ohss is uncommon .
gonal-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant ohss unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation ( containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hcg ) is administered .
it is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hcg in cases where ohss is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days .
the risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes / embryos replaced .
in patients undergoing induction of ovulation , the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception .
however , this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration .
miscarriages are higher than in the normal population , but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems .
there have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to gonal-f .
if you had this type of reaction to similar medicines , inform your doctor .
if you are a man , elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage .
gonal-f is usually not effective in such cases .
to monitor the treatment , your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment .
228 using other medicines
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
gonal-f 450 iu / 0.75 ml ( 33 micrograms / 0.75 ml ) should not be mixed with other medicines in the same injection .
gonal-f 450 iu / 0.75 ml ( 33 micrograms / 0.75 ml ) preparation is not to be mixed with other gonal-f containers within the same vial or syringe .
pregnancy and breast-feeding
gonal-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding .

pregnancy and breast-feeding
gonal-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding .
important information about some of the ingredients of gonal-f
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
how to use gonal-f
always take gonal-f exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all .
gonal-f is usually given every day .
if you have periods , the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
a commonly used dose starts at 75-150 iu fsh every day ( 0.13-0.25 ml ) .
this may be increased by 37.5-75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 iu fsh ( 0.38 ml ) .
if your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment , that treatment cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of another medicine ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies .
a commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu ( 0.25-0.38 ml ) of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle .
adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
in these cases , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
women who are not ovulating , having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as fsh and lh deficient .
your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment .
gonal-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa .
a commonly used dose starts with 75-150 iu ( 0.13-0.25 ml ) of gonal-f together with 75 iu of lutropin alfa .
according to your response , your doctor may increase your dose of gonal-f by preferably 37.5-75 iu at 7 to 14-day intervals .
if your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of gonal-f than in the abandoned cycle .
when the desired response has been obtained , a single injection of hcg is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of gonal-f and lutropin alfa .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of , and the day following , administration of the hcg .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe gonal-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle .
infertile men with hormonal deficiency .
gonal-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 iu ( 0.25 ml ) three times a week in combination with another medicine ( hcg ) for at least 4 months .
if you have not responded to treatment after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months .
route of administration
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous use , that means given by injection just under the skin .
if you administer gonal-f to yourself , please carefully read the following instructions :
individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only .
as this vial contains enough medication for several days of treatment , you need to make sure you only draw the amount of medication that was prescribed by your doctor .
the next injection should be done at the same time the next day .
your doctor has prescribed you a dose of gonal-f in iu .
you should use one of the 4 administration syringes graduated in fsh units provided .
wash your hands .
it is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible .
assemble everything you need :
find a clean area and lay out everything ( two alcohol swabs , the pre-filled syringe , containing the solvent , the vial containing gonal-f and a syringe for administration ) .
240 see illustration .
prepare the injection solution :
you should have a pre-filled syringe containing clear liquid ( the solvent ) and one vial containing gonal-f ( the white powder ) .
remove the protective caps from the gonal-f vial and from the solvent pre- filled syringe .
pick up your pre-filled syringe of solvent and slowly inject all the solvent ( 0.75 ml ) into the vial of gonal-f powder .
remove the syringe used for reconstitution from the vial and dispose of it .
this vial contains several doses of gonal-f .
you will have to keep this vial several days and only draw the dose prescribed every day .
take the syringe for administration , fill it with air to the correct dose .
shake gently the vial of gonal-f with the solvent .
insert the needle into the vial , turn the vial upside down , inject the air in the vial and draw the prescribed dose of gonal-f into the syringe for administration .
remove any air bubbles :
if you see air bubbles in the syringe , hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top .
push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone .
inject the solution :
your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject ( e. g. tummy , front of thigh ) .
wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab .
firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 angle using a dart- like motion .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger .
take as much time as you need to inject all the solution .
immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion .
dispose of all used items :
once you have finished your injection , immediately discard the syringes used safely , preferably in a sharp container .
for further injections with the reconstituted solution of gonal-f , repeat steps 4. to 7 .
the reconstituted solution is for your use alone and should not be administered to other patients .
if you use more gonal-f than you should
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4 .
however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see section 2 ) .
if you forget to take gonal-f
do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , please contact your doctor .
possible side effects
like all medicines , gonal-f can cause side effects , although not every body gets them .
side effects in women the most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts , headache and local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) .
due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see also section 2 &quot; ) can occur .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
in rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome .
in view of the above , to prevent such events , when the ovarian response is excessive , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
rarely abnormal blood clottings ( blood clots in blood vessels ) have been seen to occur with similar medicines , so this could possibly occur with gonal-f / hcg therapy or gonal-f / lutropin alfa / hcg therapy .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain ,
242 redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .
how to store gonal-f
keep out of the reach and sight of children .
prior to reconstitution , do not store above 25 c.
store in the original package in order to protect from light .
do not use gonal-f after the expiry date which is stated on the vial label or carton after exp .
the expiry date refers to the last day of that month .
once the medicine is reconstituted ( made up with the solvent ) , do not store above 25 c.
do not freeze .
store in the original container and use within 28 days .
do not use gonal-f if you notice any visible signs of deterioration .
the reconstituted solution should not be administered if it contains particles or is not clear .

further information
what gonal-f is and what it is used for
gonal-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa , which is made in laboratories by special recombinant dna techniques .
it belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins , which are involved in the normal control of reproduction .
therapeutic indications
gonal-f can be used to cause ovulation in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles ( and therefore several eggs ) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation , gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer .
gonal-f is used in combination with another medicine , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) , to produce sperm in men who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency .
before you use gonal-f
you and your partner &apos;s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started .
do not use gonal-f
if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of gonal-f if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
if you are a woman :
if you have ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease if you have gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause if you have ovarian , uterine or breast cancer
the medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as premature menopause , malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb .
if you are a man :
if you have irreversible testicular damage .
take special care with gonal-f
if you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria ( a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children ) , you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness .
if you are a woman , this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) ( see section 4 ) .
however , if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to , the occurrence of ohss is uncommon .
gonal-f treatment seldom gives rise to significant ohss unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation ( containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hcg ) is administered .
it is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hcg in cases where ohss is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days .
the risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes / embryos replaced .
in patients undergoing induction of ovulation , the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception .
however , this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration .
miscarriages are higher than in the normal population , but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems .
there have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to gonal-f .
if you had this type of reaction to similar medicines , inform your doctor .
if you are a man , elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage .
gonal-f is usually not effective in such cases .
to monitor the treatment , your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment .
using other medicines
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
pregnancy and breast-feeding
gonal-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding .

this may be increased by 37.5-75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually lower than 225 iu fsh ( 0.36 ml ) .
if your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment , that treatment cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .

women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies .
a commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu ( 0.24-0.36 ml ) of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle .
adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5000 iu up to 10 000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
in these cases , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .

according to your response , your doctor may increase your dose of gonal-f by preferably 37.5-75 iu at 7 to 14-day intervals .
if your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 5 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of gonal-f than in the abandoned cycle .
when the desired response has been obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of gonal-f and lutropin alfa .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of , and the day following , administration of the hcg .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe gonal-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle .
infertile men with hormonal deficiency .
gonal-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 iu ( 0.24 ml ) three times a week in combination with another medicine ( hcg ) for at least 4 months .
if you have not responded to treatment after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months .
route of administration
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous use , that means given by injection just under the skin .
if you administer gonal-f to yourself , please carefully read the following instructions :
individual pre-filled pens should be for single patient use only .
prepare the gonal-f pre-filled pen and inject the solution once dose has been selected .
the next injection should be done at the same time the next day .
your doctor has prescribed you a dose of gonal-f in iu .
wash your hands .
it is important that your hands and the items you use are as clean as possible .
assemble everything you need :
find a clean area and lay out everything ( two alcohol swabs , the pre-filled pen and a needle for administration ) .
see illustration .
preparing the gonal-f pre-filled pen to first use :
remove the pen cap and attach a needle as described in section 3 .
then prime the pen by setting the dose arrow at 37.5 black scale-mark highlighted with a small dot .
pull out the injection button as far as it will go , remove the outer needle cap and the inner needle cap and hold the pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upwards .
tap the reservoir holder gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle .
with the needle still pointing upwards , depress the injection button fully .
a drop of liquid must appear at the tip of the needle ; this indicates that your pre-filled pen is primed for injection .
the amount of liquid seen at the needle tip is just the overfill from the pre-filled pen ( generally less than 37.5 iu ) .
if no liquid appears the first time , repeat a second time until a drop of liquid appears at the needle tip .
then set the dose as describe in section 4 .
for the next usage attach a needle as described in section 3 and set the dose as described in section 4 .
attaching a needle :
take a new needle .
if the peel tab closing the outer needle cap is damaged or loose , do not use it .
discard the needle and take a new one .
remove the peel tab from the outer needle cap .
hold the outer needle cap firmly , press the threaded tip of the pre-filled pen into the outer needle cap and twist it clockwise until it is securely fixed .
caution :
use only the single-use disposable needles provided within the gonal-f pre-filled pen pack or distributed separately .
setting the dose :
the minimum dose and the maximum dose that you can set are respectively equal to 37.5 iu and 300 iu ) .
once you have set your dose , load it by pulling the injection button out as far as it will go .
take care to pull the button straight and not to twist it out , this might change the set dose .
caution : carefully check the dosage dial before pulling out the injection button because it cannot be corrected after it has been loaded .
if after having pulled out the injection button you realize that you have set and loaded a wrong dose , do not inject .
discard the dose to waste and repeat the dose setting correctly .
if the loaded dose is lower than the set dose , then the dose will not be complete .
in this case , follow the instructions given below in the point 2. of the note section .
if the same dose is required every time , then the dose arrow can be left pointing at the same position on the dosage dial .
injecting the dose :
choose an injection site according to the instructions given by your medical practitioner or nurse .
clean the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab .
use the injection technique as advised by your medical practitioner or nurse .
insert the needle into the skin and press the injection button as far as it will go .
this confirms that the delivery of the dose is complete .
you must keep the needle in the skin and press down the injection button for at least 10 seconds .
whilst keeping the injection button pressed down , take the needle out of the skin .
removing the needle :
remove the needle after each injection and discard it .
hold the pre-filled pen firmly by the reservoir holder .
carefully put back the outer needle cap onto the needle .
grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning counterclockwise .
dispose of the used needle safely .
now put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen .
storing the pre-filled pen :
after injecting your dose remove the used needle as described in the point 6 above .
put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen .
store the gonal-f pre- filled pen in a safe place , preferably in the original package .
when the pre-filled pen is empty , discard it .
the scale that can be seen through the reservoir holder is an indicator of the medicine volume remaining in the reservoir .
it must not be used to set the dose .
the red dosage control dial on the injection button enables you to check whether the last dose will be complete or not .
it can only be pulled out as far as the mark ( flat arrow ) indicating the amount of medicine remaining in the reservoir .
if the loaded dose is not sufficient to complete your injection , you have two possibilities : a .
inject the partial dose ( remained in this pre-filled pen ) and then complete immediately the injection of the rest of the dose using a new pre-filled pen ( do not to forget to record the partial dose ) . b .
discard the pre-filled pen and inject the full dose using a new pre-filled pen .
if you use more gonal-f than you should
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4 .
however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see section 2 ) .
if you forget to take gonal-f
do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , please contact your doctor .
possible side effects
like all medicines , gonal-f can cause side effects , although not every body gets them .
side effects in women the most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts , headache and local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) .
these problems may affect more than 10 patients out of 100 treated .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see section 2 ) can occur ( between 1 and 10 patients out of 100 treated patients ) .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
this can occurs in 1 of the patients or less .
in very rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( less than 1 patient in 1000 ) .
in order to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
253 side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg ( between 1 and 10 of the patients ) .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .

it belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins , which are involved in the normal control of reproduction .
therapeutic indications
gonal-f can be used to cause ovulation in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate .
gonal-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles ( and therefore several eggs ) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation , gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer .
gonal-f is used in combination with another medicine , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) , to produce sperm in men who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency .
before you use gonal-f
you and your partner &apos;s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started .
do not use gonal-f
if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to follicle stimulating hormone or to any of the other ingredients of gonal-f if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
258 if you are a woman :
if you have ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease if you have gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause if you have ovarian , uterine or breast cancer
the medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible , such as premature menopause , malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb .
if you are a man :
if you have irreversible testicular damage
take special care with gonal-f
if you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria ( a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children ) , you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness .
if you are a woman , this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) ( see section 4 ) .
however , if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to , the occurrence of ohss is uncommon .
gonal-f treatment seldom gives rise to significant ohss unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation ( containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hcg ) is administered .
it is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hcg in cases where ohss is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days .
the risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes / embryos replaced .
in patients undergoing induction of ovulation , the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception .
however , this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration .
miscarriages are higher than in the normal population , but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems .
there have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to gonal-f .
if you had this type of reaction to similar medicines , inform your doctor .
if you are a man , elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage .
gonal-f is usually not effective in such cases .
to monitor the treatment , your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment .
using other medicines :
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
no other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during gonal-f therapy .
259 pregnancy and breast-feeding
gonal-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding .
important information about some of the ingredients of gonal-f
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium-free &quot; .
how to use gonal-f
always take gonal-f exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all .
gonal-f is usually given every day .
if you have periods , the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle .
a commonly used dose starts at 75-150 iu fsh every day ( 0.12-0.24 ml ) .
this may be increased by 37.5-75 iu at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary , to obtain an adequate , but not excessive , response .
the maximal daily dose is usually lower than 225 iu fsh ( 0.36 ml ) .
if your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment , that treatment cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle .
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of another medicine ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle .
women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies .
a commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 iu ( 0.24-0.36 ml ) of gonal-f daily , commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle .
adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment ( range 5 to 20 days ) .
then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5000 iu up to 10 000 iu human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) is administered 24-48 hours after the last gonal-f injection .
in these cases , gonal-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment , both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved .
for example , following two weeks of treatment with an agonist , 150-225 iu gonal-f are administered for the first 7 days .
the dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response .
260 women who are not ovulating , having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as fsh and lh deficient .
your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment .
gonal-f is usually taken every day for up to five weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa .
a commonly used dose starts with 75-150 iu ( 0.12-0.24 ml ) of gonal-f together with 75 iu of lutropin alfa .
according to your response , your doctor may increase your dose of gonal-f by preferably 37.5-75 iu at 7 to 14-day intervals .
if your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 5 weeks of treatment , that cycle should be abandoned .
for the following cycle , your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of gonal-f than in the abandoned cycle .
when the desired response has been obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hcg or 5000 iu up to 10 000 iu hcg is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of gonal-f and lutropin alfa .
you are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of , and the day following , administration of the hcg .
alternatively , intrauterine insemination ( iui ) may be performed .
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg withheld ( see section 4 ) .
for the following cycle , your doctor will prescribe gonal-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle .
infertile men with hormonal deficiency .
gonal-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 iu ( 0.24 ml ) three times a week in combination with another medicine ( hcg ) for at least 4 months .
if you have not responded to treatment after this period , your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months .
route of administration
gonal-f is intended for subcutaneous use , that means given by injection just under the skin .
if you administer gonal-f to yourself , please carefully read the following instructions :
individual pre-filled pens should be for single patient use only .
prepare the gonal-f pre-filled pen and inject the solution once dose has been selected .
the next injection should be done at the same time the next day .
your doctor has prescribed you a dose of gonal-f in iu .
wash your hands .
it is important that your hands and the items you use are as clean as possible .
assemble everything you need :
find a clean area and lay out everything ( two alcohol swabs , the pre-filled pen and a needle for administration ) .
see illustration .
preparing the gonal-f pre-filled pen to first use :
remove the pen cap and attach a needle as described in section 4 .
then prime the pen by setting the dose arrow at 37.5 scale-mark highlighted with a small dot .
pull out the injection button as far as it will go , remove the outer needle cap and the inner needle cap and hold the pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upwards .
tap the reservoir holder gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle .
with the needle still pointing upwards , depress the injection button fully .
a drop of liquid must appear at the tip of the needle ; this indicates that your pre-filled pen is primed for injection .
the amount of liquid seen at the needle tip is just the overfill from the pre-filled pen ( generally less than 37.5 iu ) .
if no liquid appears the first time , repeat a second time until a drop of liquid appears at the needle tip .
then set the dose as describe in section 4 .
for the next usage attach a needle as described in section 3 and set the dose as described in section 4 .
attaching a needle :
take a new needle .
if the peel tab closing the outer needle cap is damaged or loose , do not use it .
discard the needle and take a new one .
remove the peel tab from the outer needle cap .
hold the outer needle cap firmly , press the threaded tip of the pre-filled pen into the outer needle cap and twist it clockwise until it is securely fixed .
caution :
use only the single-use disposable needles provided within the gonal-f pre-filled pen pack or distributed separately .
setting the dose :
the minimum dose and the maximum dose that you can set are respectively equal to 37.5 iu and 450 iu ) .
once you have set your dose , load it by pulling the injection button out as far as it will go .
take care to pull the button straight and not to twist it out , this might change the set dose .
caution : carefully check the dosage dial before pulling out the injection button because it cannot be corrected after it has been loaded .
if after having pulled out the injection button you realize that you have set and loaded a wrong dose , do not inject .
discard the dose to waste and repeat the dose setting correctly .
if the loaded dose is lower than the set dose , then the dose will not be complete .
in this case , follow the instructions given below in the point 2. of the note section .
if the same dose is required every time , then the dose arrow can be left pointing at the same position on the dosage dial .
injecting the dose :
choose an injection site according to the instructions given by your medical practitioner or nurse .
clean the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab .
use the injection technique as advised by your medical practitioner or nurse .
insert the needle into the skin and press the injection button as far as it will go .
this confirms that the delivery of the dose is complete .
you must keep the needle in the skin and press down the injection button for at least 10 seconds .
whilst keeping the injection button pressed down , take the needle out of the skin .
removing the needle :
remove the needle after each injection and discard it .
hold the pre-filled pen firmly by the reservoir holder .
carefully put back the outer needle cap onto the needle .
grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning counterclockwise .
dispose of the used needle safely .
now put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen .
storing the pre-filled pen :
after injecting your dose remove the used needle as described in the point 6 above .
put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen .
store the gonal-f pre- filled pen in a safe place , preferably in the original package .
when the pre-filled pen is empty , discard it .
the scale that can be seen through the reservoir holder is an indicator of the medicine volume remaining in the reservoir .
it must not be used to set the dose .
the red dosage control dial on the injection button enables you to check whether the last dose will be complete or not .
it can only be pulled out as far as the mark ( flat arrow ) indicating the amount of medicine remaining in the reservoir .
if the loaded dose is not sufficient to complete your injection , you have two possibilities : a .
inject the partial dose ( remained in this pre-filled pen ) and then complete immediately the injection of the rest of the dose using a new pre-filled pen ( do not forget to record the partial dose ) . b .
discard the pre-filled pen and inject the full dose using a new pre-filled pen .
if you use more gonal-f than you should
the effects of an overdose of gonal-f are unknown , nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur , which is further described in section 4 .
however this will only occur if hcg is administered ( see section 2 )
if you forget to take gonal-f
do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose , please contact your doctor .
possible side effects
like all medicines , gonal-f can cause side effects , although not every body gets them .
side effects in women the most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts , headache and local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) .
these problems may affect more than 10 patients out of 100 treated .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see section 2 ) can occur ( between 1 and 10 patients out of 100 treated patients ) .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
this can occurs in 1 of the patients or less .
in very rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( less than 1 patient in 1000 ) .
in order to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
264 side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg ( between 1 and 10 of the patients ) .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

these problems may effect more than 10 patients out of 100 treated .
following treatment with gonal-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered , a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( see also section 2 ) can occur ( between 1 and 10 patients out of 100 treated patients ) .
this syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts .
first symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region , possibly in combination with nausea , vomiting and weight gain .
should the above mentioned symptoms occur , a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible .
in serious , but rare cases , an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries , can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications .
this can occurs in 1 of the patients or less .
in very rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( less than 1 patient in 1000 ) .
in order to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome , treatment with gonal-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hcg abandoned .
very rare cases of allergic reactions to gonal-f have occurred causing redness of the skin , rash , swelling , hives and difficulty in breathing .
these reactions can sometimes be serious .
very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition .
ectopic pregnancy ( embryo implanted outside the womb ) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease .
275 side effects in men men may experience some breast development , acne or weight gain due to treatment with hcg ( between 1 and 10 of the patients ) .
some men undergoing treatment with gonal-f may experience local reactions at the injection site ( pain , redness , bruising , swelling and / or irritation ) or may develop a varicocele ( swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle ) .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

what is prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals ? prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals &apos; is a vaccine that is given by injection .
it contains parts of influenza ( flu ) viruses that have been inactivated ( killed ) .
the vaccine contains a flu strain called a / vietnam / 1194 / 2004 nibrg-14 &apos; ( h5n1 ) .
this vaccine is the same as prepandrix , which is already authorised in the european union ( eu ) .
the company that makes prepandrix has agreed that its scientific data can be used for this vaccine .
the vaccine is given according to official recommendations .
the vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is the vaccine used ?
the vaccine is given by injection into the upper arm muscle in two doses , at least three weeks apart .
how does the vaccine work ? prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals &apos; is a prepandemic &apos;vaccine .
this is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of flu that may cause a future pandemic .
a flu pandemic happens when a new strain of flu virus appears that can spread easily from person to person because people have no immunity ( protection ) against it .
a pandemic can affect most countries and regions around the world .
health experts are concerned that the next flu pandemic could be caused by the h5n1 strain of the virus .
the vaccine has been developed to provide protection against this strain , so that it can be used before or during a flu pandemic .
when a person is given the vaccine , the immune system recognises the virus as foreign &apos;and makes antibodies against it .
the immune system will then be able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is exposed to the virus again .
this may help to protect against the disease caused by the virus .
before use , the vaccine is made up by mixing together a suspension that contains the virus particles with an emulsion .
the resulting emulsion &apos;is then injected .
the emulsion contains an adjuvant &apos; ( a compound containing oil ) to stimulate a better response .
how has the vaccine been studied ?
the effects of the vaccine were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
the main study of the vaccine included 400 healthy adults and compared the ability of different doses of the vaccine , with or without the adjuvant , to trigger the production of antibodies ( immunogenicity ) .
the participants received two injections of the vaccine containing one of four different doses of haemagglutinin .
the injections were given 21 days apart .
the main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies against the flu virus in the blood at three different times : before vaccination , on the day of the second injection ( day 21 ) and 21 days later ( day 42 ) .
additional studies were used to support the main study and to demonstrate the vaccine &apos;s safety .
what benefit has the vaccine shown during the studies ?
according to criteria laid down by the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) , a prepandemic vaccine needs to bring about protective levels of antibodies in at least 70 of people for it to be considered suitable .
the main study showed that the vaccine containing 3.75 micrograms of haemagglutinin and the adjuvant produced an antibody response that met these criteria .
at 21 days after the second injection , 84 of the people receiving the vaccine had levels of antibodies that would protect them against h5n1 .
what is the risk associated with the vaccine ?
for the full list of all side effects reported with the vaccine , see the package leaflet .
vaccination should be delayed in people who have a sudden fever .
why has the vaccine been approved ?
the chmp decided that the benefits of prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals &apos; are greater than its risks for active immunisation against h5n1 subtype of influenza a virus .
the committee recommended that the vaccine be given marketing authorisation .
other information about the vaccine :
the european commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the eu for prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals &apos; to glaxosmithkline biologicals s. a. on 26 september 2008 .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
active immunisation against h5n1 subtype of influenza a virus .
this indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects aged 18-60 years following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared from a / vietnam / 1194 / 2004 nibrg-14 ( h5n1 ) ( see section 5.1 ) .
prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals 3.75 g should be used in accordance with official guidance .
posology and method of administration
posology
adults from the age of 18 to 60 years :
1 dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date .
a second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks .
there is no experience in children and adults above 60 years of age .
2 for further information , see section 5.1 .
method of administration
immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection .
contraindications
see sections 4.4 , 4.8 and 6.1 .
acute severe febrile illness .
immunisation should be postponed .
special warnings and precautions for use
as with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine .
prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals 3.75 g should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally .
antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient .
a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees ( see section 5.1 ) .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
the vaccine should not usually be given at the same time as other vaccines .
however , if co- administration with another vaccine is considered to be essential , the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs .
it should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified .
the immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment .
following influenza vaccination , false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the elisa method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( hiv-1 ) , hepatitis c virus and , especially , htlv-1 .
these transitory false-positive results may be due to igm production in response to the vaccine .
pregnancy and lactation
no data have been generated in pregnant women with prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals 3.75 g or with any other vaccine that contains the as03 adjuvant .
animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility , pregnancy , embryonal / foetal development , parturition or post-natal development ( see section 5.3 ) .
healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations .
3 there are no data regarding the use of prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals 3.75 g during lactation .
the potential benefits to the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals 3.75 g during lactation .

information from non-clinical studies :
the ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed non-clinically using ferret challenge models .
in each experiment , four groups of six ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with an as03 adjuvanted vaccine containing ha derived from h5n1 / a / vietnam / 1194 / 04 ( nibrg-14 ) .
doses of 15 , 5 , 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms of ha were tested in the homologous challenge experiment , and doses of 15 , 7.5 , 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms of ha were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment .
control groups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone , non-adjuvanted vaccine ( 15 micrograms ha ) or phosphate buffered saline solution .
ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the intra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either h5n1 / a / vietnam / 1194 / 04 or heterologous h5n1 / a / indonesia / 5 / 05 .
of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine , 87 and 96 were protected against the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge , respectively .
viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls , suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission .
in the unadjuvanted control group , as well as in the adjuvant control group , all animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund , three to four days after the start of challenge .

what is hbvaxpro ?
hbvaxpro is a vaccine , which is available as a suspension for injection in vials and pre-filled syringes .
it contains parts of the hepatitis b virus as the active substance .
hbvaxpro is available in two strengths ( 10 and 40 micrograms / ml ) .
what is hbvaxpro used for ?
hbvaxpro is used to vaccinate against hepatitis b in people who are at risk of exposure to the hepatitis b virus , as determined on the basis of official recommendations .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is hbvaxpro used ?
a course of vaccination should include at least three injections of hbvaxpro .
the recommended dose for children up to the age of 15 years is 0.5 ml of the lower strength ( 10 micrograms / ml ) at each injection .
for adults and adolescents aged 16 years of age and older , 1 ml of the lower strength is given at each injection .
the higher strength ( 40 micrograms / ml ) is used in patients who are undergoing or are about to undergo dialysis ( a blood clearance technique ) .
hbvaxpro is usually given as an injection into the muscle of the thigh in babies and infants , and of the shoulder in children , adolescents and adults .
the timing of injections depends on the patient &apos; s age , strength of the immune system , response to vaccination and likelihood of exposure to the hepatitis b virus .
for full details , see the summary of product characteristics ( also part of the epar ) .
how does hbvaxpro work ?
hbvaxpro is a vaccine .
vaccines work by teaching &apos;the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against a disease .
hbvaxpro contains small amounts of surface antigens &apos; ( proteins from the surface ) of the hepatitis b virus .
the immune system will then be able to produce antibodies more quickly when the person is naturally exposed to the viruses .
this helps to protect against infection with the hepatitis b virus .
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. the proteins .
the surface antigens are also adsorbed .
this means that they are fixed onto aluminium compounds to help stimulate a better response .
hbvaxpro was specifically developed from a vaccine that was already in use in the european union ( eu ) , in order to remove the preservative thiomersal , which contains mercury .
repeated exposure to mercury from sources such as medicines and foods could lead to it building up in the organs .
this build-up could be dangerous and is a cause of concern .
how has hbvaxpro been studied ?
because the active substance used in hbvaxpro was already authorised for use in the eu , there have been no formal studies of hbvaxpro .
the company provided information comparing other vaccines with and without thiomersal , including studies of a vaccine that contains the same active substance as hbvaxpro .
what benefit has hbvaxpro shown during the studies ?
the results of the studies presented showed that the thiomersal-free vaccines produced protective levels of antibodies against hepatitis b virus to a similar extent to the vaccines that contained thiomersal at the end of the vaccination course .
this included the vaccines that contain the same active substance as hbvaxpro .
what is the risk associated with hbvaxpro ?
the most common side effects with hbvaxpro ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are reactions at the injection site , including temporary soreness , erythema ( redness ) and induration ( hardening ) .
for the full list of side effects reported with hbvaxpro , see the package leaflet .
hbvaxpro should not be given to people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to the active substance or any of the other ingredients .
it should not be used in people with a severe fever .
as for all vaccines , if hbvaxpro is used in very premature babies , there is a risk of the babies experiencing apnoea ( brief pauses in breathing ) .
their breathing should be monitored for up to three days after vaccination .
why has hbvaxpro been approved ?
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) concluded that the removal of thiomersal from vaccines did not reduce their effectiveness in protecting against hepatitis b virus infection , but reduced their risks .
the committee recommended that hbvaxpro be given marketing authorisation .
other information about hbvaxpro :
the european commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the eu for hbvaxpro to sanofi pasteur msd snc on 27 april 2001 .
the marketing authorisation was renewed on 27 april 2006 .
the full epar for hbvaxpro can be found here .

summary of product characteristics
name of the medicinal product
hbvaxpro 5 micrograms / 0.5 ml suspension for injection hepatitis b vaccine ( rdna )
qualitative and quantitative composition
one dose ( 0.5 ml ) contains :
micrograms adsorbed on amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate ( 0.25 milligram al )
produced from recombinant strain of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae ( strain 2150-2-3 )
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1
pharmaceutical form
suspension for injection slightly opaque white suspension .
clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
the specific at risk categories to be immunised are to be determined on the basis of the official recommendations .
it can be expected that hepatitis d will also be prevented by immunisation with hbvaxpro as hepatitis d ( caused by the delta agent ) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis b infection .
posology and method of administration
posology children and adolescents ( birth through 15 years of age ) :
1 dose ( 5 g ) of 0.5 ml at each injection is intended for use .
primary vaccination :
a course of vaccination should include at least three injections .
two primary immunisation schedules can be recommended :
0 , 1 , 6 months : two injections with an interval of one month ; a third injection 6 months after the first administration .
2 0 , 1 , 2 , 12 months : three injections with an interval of one month ; a fourth dose should be administered at 12 months .
it is recommended that the vaccine be administered in the schedules indicated .
infants receiving the compressed regimen ( 0 , 1 , 2 months dosing schedule ) must receive the 12 month booster to induce higher antibody titres .
booster :
immunocompetent vaccinees
the need for a booster dose in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course has not been established .
however , some local vaccination schedules currently include a recommendation for a booster dose and these should be respected .
immunocompromised vaccinees ( e. g. dialysis patients , transplant patients )
in vaccinees with an impaired immune system , administration of additional doses of vaccine should be considered if the antibody level against hepatitis b virus surface antigen ( anti-hbsag ) is less than 10 iu / l .
revaccination of nonresponders
when persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series are revaccinated , 15-25 produce an adequate antibody response after one additional dose and 30-50 after three additional doses .
however , because data are insufficient concerning the safety of hepatitis b vaccine when additional doses in excess of the recommended series are administered , revaccination following completion of the primary series is not routinely recommended .
revaccination should be considered for high-risk individuals , after weighing the benefits of vaccination against the potential risk of experiencing increased local or systemic adverse reactions .
special dosage recommendations :
dosage recommendation for neonates of mothers who are hepatitis b virus carriers
- at birth , one dose of hepatitis b immunoglobulin ( within 24 hours ) .
- the first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of birth and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis b immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site .
- subsequent doses of vaccine should be given according to the locally recommended vaccination
schedule .
dosage recommendation for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis b virus ( e. g needlestick with contaminated needle )
- hepatitis b immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure ( within 24 hours ) .
- the first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis b immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site .
- serologic testing is also recommended , with the administration of subsequent doses of vaccine , if
necessary , ( i. e according to the serologic status of the patient ) for short and long term protection .
- in the case of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals , additional doses should be
given as in the recommended immunisation schedule .
the accelerated schedule including the 12 month booster dose can be proposed .
3 method of administration this vaccine should be administered intramuscularly .
the anterolateral thigh is the preferred site for injection in neonates and infants .
the deltoid muscle is the preferred site for injection in children and adolescents .
do not inject intravascularly .
exceptionally , the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopoenia or bleeding disorders .
see section 6.6 for the instructions for preparation
contraindications
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- severe febrile illness
special warnings and precautions for use
because of the long incubation period of hepatitis b , it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis b infection to be present at the time of vaccination .
the vaccine may not prevent hepatitis b infection in such cases .
the vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis a , hepatitis c and hepatitis e and other pathogens known to infect the liver .
as with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine .
this vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate , which are used during the manufacturing process .
therefore , sensitisation reactions may occur .
as the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants , vaccination should not be withheld or delayed .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
this vaccine can be administered :
- with hepatitis b immunoglobulin , at a separate injection site .
- to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have previously
received another hepatitis b vaccine .
- concomitantly with other vaccines , using separate sites and syringes .
the concomitant administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( prevenar ) given with hepatitis b vaccine using the 0 , 1 and 6 and 0 , 1 , 2 and 12 month schedules has not been sufficiently studied .
pregnancy and lactation
not applicable .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
4 not relevant .
undesirable effects
the following undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of the vaccine .
as with other hepatitis b vaccines , in many instances , the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established .
blood and the lymphatic system disorders very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) thrombocytopenia , lymphadenopathy
immune system disorders very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) serum sickness , anaphylaxis , polyarteritis nodosa
vascular disorders very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) hypotension , vasculitis
respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) bronchospasm-like symptoms , apnoea in very premature infants ( 28 weeks of gestation ) ( see section 4.4 )
gastrointestinal disorders very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) vomiting , nausea , diarrhoea , abdominal pain
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) rash , alopecia , pruritus , urticaria , erythema multiforme , angioedema , eczema
musculoskeletal , connective tissue and bone disorders very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) arthralgia , arthritis , myalgia , pain in extremity
general disorders and administration site conditions common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) local reactions ( injection site ) : transient soreness , erythema , induration very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) fatigue , fever , malaise , influenza-like symptoms
5 investigations very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) elevation of liver enzymes
no case of overdose has been reported .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : anti-infectious , atc code :
the vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis b virus surface antigen ( anti-hbsag ) .
in two infant trials using different dosing schedules and concomitant vaccines , the proportion of infants with protective levels of antibodies were 97.5 and 97.2 with geometric mean titres of 214 and 297 iu / l , respectively .
among 130 vaccinated infants , the estimated efficacy in prevention of chronic hepatitis b infection was 95 as compared to the infection rate in untreated historical controls .
as with other hepatitis b vaccines , the duration of the protective effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present .
the need for a booster dose of hbvaxpro is not yet defined beyond the 12 month booster dose required for the 0 , 1 , 2 compressed schedule .
reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis b virus infection .
studies have demonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis b infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 of hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis b virus infection .
hepatitis b vaccine has been recognized as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer .

a course of vaccination should include at least three injections .
two primary immunisation schedules can be recommended :
0 , 1 , 6 months : two injections with an interval of one month ; a third injection 6 months after the first administration .
9 0 , 1 , 2 , 12 months : three injections with an interval of one month ; a fourth dose should be administered at 12 months .
it is recommended that the vaccine be administered in the schedules indicated .
infants receiving the compressed regimen ( 0 , 1 , 2 months dosing schedule ) must receive the 12 month booster to induce higher antibody titres .
booster :
immunocompetent vaccinees
the need for a booster dose in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course has not been established .
however , some local vaccination schedules currently include a recommendation for a booster dose and these should be respected .
immunocompromised vaccinees ( e. g. dialysis patients , transplant patients )
in vaccinees with an impaired immune system , administration of additional doses of vaccine should be considered if the antibody level against hepatitis b virus surface antigen ( anti-hbsag ) is less than 10 iu / l .
revaccination of nonresponders
when persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series are revaccinated , 15-25 produce an adequate antibody response after one additional dose and 30-50 after three additional doses .
however , because data are insufficient concerning the safety of hepatitis b vaccine when additional doses in excess of the recommended series are administered , revaccination following completion of the primary series is not routinely recommended .
revaccination should be considered for high-risk individuals , after weighing the benefits of vaccination against the potential risk of experiencing increased local or systemic adverse reactions .
special dosage recommendations :
dosage recommendations for neonates born to mothers who are hepatitis b virus carriers
- at birth , one dose of hepatitis b immunoglobulin ( within 24 hours ) .
- the first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of birth and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis b immunoglobulin at birth , but at a separate injection site .
- subsequent doses of vaccine should be given according to the locally recommended vaccination
schedule .
dosage recommendation for known or presumed exposure to hepatitis b virus ( e. g needlestick with contaminated needle )
- hepatitis b immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible after exposure ( within 24 hours ) .
- the first dose of the vaccine should be given within 7 days of exposure and can be administered
simultaneously with hepatitis b immunoglobulin but at a separate injection site .
- serologic testing is also recommended , with the administration of subsequent doses of vaccine , if
necessary , ( i. e according to the serologic status of the patient ) for short and long term protection .
- in the case of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals , additional doses should be given
as in the recommended immunisation schedule .
the accelerated schedule including the 12 month booster dose can be proposed .
method of administration
the anterolateral thigh is the preferred site for injection in neonates and infants .
the deltoid muscle is the preferred site for injection in children and adolescents .
do not inject intravascularly .
exceptionally , the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopoenia or bleeding disorders .
see section 6.6 for the instructions for preparation
contraindications
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- severe febrile illness
special warnings and precautions for use
because of the long incubation period of hepatitis b , it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis b infection to be present at the time of vaccination .
the vaccine may not prevent hepatitis b infection in such cases .
the vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis a , hepatitis c and hepatitis e and other pathogens known to infect the liver .
as with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine .
this vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and potassium thiocyanate which are used during the manufacturing process .
therefore , sensitisation reactions may occur .
as the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants , vaccination should not be withheld or delayed .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
this vaccine can be administered :
- with hepatitis b immunoglobulin , at a separate injection site .
- to complete a primary immunisation course or as a booster dose in subjects who have
previously received another hepatitis b vaccine .
- concomitantly with other vaccines , using separate sites and syringes .
the concomitant administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( prevenar ) given with hepatitis b vaccine using the 0 , 1 and 6 and 0 , 1 , 2 and 12 month schedules has not been sufficiently studied .
pregnancy and lactation
not applicable .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
undesirable effects
the following undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of the vaccine .
as with other hepatitis b vaccines , in many instances , the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established .

pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : anti-infectious , atc code :
the vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis b virus surface antigen ( anti-hbsag ) .
in two infant trials using different dosing schedules and concomitant vaccines , the proportion of infants with protective levels of antibodies were 97.5 and 97.2 with geometric mean titres of 214 and 297 iu / l , respectively .
among 130 vaccinated infants , the estimated efficacy in prevention of chronic hepatitis b infection was 95 as compared to the infection rate in untreated historical controls .
as with other hepatitis b vaccines , the duration of the protective effect in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present .
the need for a booster dose of hbvaxpro is not yet defined beyond the 12 month booster dose required for the 0 , 1 , 2 compressed schedule .
reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication of hepatitis b virus infection .
studies have demonstrated the link between chronic hepatitis b infection and hepatocellular carcinoma and 80 of hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by hepatitis b virus infection .
hepatitis b vaccine has been recognized as the first anti-cancer vaccine because it can prevent primary liver cancer .

scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation of the marketing authorisation of hbvaxpro presented by the emea
hbvaxpro is a monovalent vaccine developed for the active immunisation against hepatitis b virus infection caused by all known subtypes in all age groups considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis b virus .
the active substance of hbvaxpro , hepatitis b ( recombinant ) vaccine , is purified hepatitis b virus surface antigen , recombinant ( hbsag ) .
hbvaxpro is a vaccine inducing a specific humoral and cellular immune response against hbsag , which results in an active immunisation against hepatitis b virus infection .
the benefits with hbvaxpro are the protective efficacy against hepatitis b in all age groups in absence of thiomersal in the finished product .
issues pertaining to the relatively low immunogenicity of the hepatitis b ( hepb ) component contained in the vaccines containing the recombinant hepatitis b component from spmsd have been assessed and extensively discussed by the chmp and its working parties ( biotechnology working party , vaccines working party ) .
on 26 may 2005 , the chmp agreed on the need to convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on hepatitis short and long-term protection afforded by recombinant hepatitis b vaccines .
the chmp expressed concerns that there is evidence of unpredictable variability in hepatitis b antibody response following vaccination with hexavac .
this variability seems to be related to currently uncontrollable variances in the manufacturing process of the recombinant hepb vaccine component .
concerns were expressed on the low immunogenicity of the hepb component of hexavac and the potential consequences on long-term protection against hepatitis b infection and boostability post primary course of vaccination with this vaccine .
in their january 2006 plenary meeting , the chmp confirmed their concerns regarding the decreasing immunogenicity of the recombinant hep b component contained in hbvaxpro and procomvax .
the chmp debated the current lack of knowledge about the clinical significance of the findings and immune memory in general and agreed that these issues needed to be carefully explored before deciding on regulatory action .
the committee also noted that the last study performed in infants below one year was completed in 2001 .
as a consequence the data obtained so far must be interpreted with caution since they were generated using the paediatric ( 5 g ) dose of hep b vaccine produced before 2001 .
there are some indications that the hep b vaccine currently produced is less immunogenic than the vaccine produced in the 1990 &apos;s .
the reason for decreasing immunogenicity over several years remains still unidentified .
it was considered that a decision will be taken according to the responses given on quality and clinical concerns .
on 13 february 2006 , the european commission ( ec ) triggered the procedure under article 20 of regulation ( ec ) no 726 / 2004 , after the chmp expressed concerns on the low immunogenicity of the hepb component of hbvaxpro .
discussion
from the quality point of view , there are no technical , analytical or animal tools able to predict immunogenicity of recombinant hepatitis b components in man .
analytical tools can be used as consistency criteria , but not as correlates for safety and efficacy ( immunogenicity ) of hepatitis b batches produced at spmsd .
notwithstanding , the new proposed model will have only predictive value once it has been fully validated and has shown to be able to discriminate batches of hbvaxpro that have elicited a high vs. a low immune response during clinical trials .
although the root cause for reduced immunogenicity during the past 5 years is still not ascertained , evidence was provided that the manufacturing process seems now to be better controlled .
the mah developed an upgraded manufacturing process to increase immunogenicity .
the data reviewed by chmp included data from 7 studies with hbvaxpro and procomvax , one of which is on-going at present .
these trials were carried out in different risk groups and age categories , i. e. children born to hepatitis b positive mothers , infants , healthy young adults and healthy subjects between 16-35 years of age .
in the studies conducted by the mah to date with hbvaxpro and procomvax , seroprotective levels have been achieved in the large majority of vaccinees .
there is no evidence that either short or long term protection has been impacted .
in addition , a review of clinical performance as assessed by protection against disease as noted in the v121-018 trial supports the conclusion that the hepatitis b vaccines remain effective in decreasing hepatitis b infection and its serious sequelae .
due to the relatively high risk of infection , the group of infants born to hepatitis b positive mothers represents the population , which would be most vulnerable to a possible insufficient immunogenicity of the vaccine .
as there are currently no reports on increased numbers of hepatitis b breakthrough cases after hbvaxpro vaccination , considering that the eu is a low endemic region , no immediate safety signal could be identified by the chmp .
the results from these three trials with product manufactured in the current facility , confirm solid , reproducible performance based on these recent historical data and should also predict performance as expected in other populations as well .
in the past experience , there has never been an instance when high performance in adolescents and young adults did not correspond with high performance in infants .
therefore , the results of this study provide evidence that the currently available product is providing the expected level of protective antibodies in all populations for which it is indicated .
the chmp agreed with the mah on revised product information for all presentations of hbvaxpro , reflecting advice and suggestions made during the procedure .
revised spcs and pls provide updated information in relation to best use of the product considering latest clinical data .
these changes , in principle , address the concerns raised by the chmp and its working parties .
pending the outcome of the studies , the mah committed to amend the spc sections 4.2 , 4.4 , 4.5 ( where relevant ) and 5.1 as follows :
the chmp reviewed all the technical and clinical data available for hbvaxpro extensively .
the chmp concluded that the use of this vaccine will not pose an immediate risk to any of the target groups the vaccine is indicated for .
potential remaining risks will be minimised to an acceptable level by the fundamentally revised spc .
information will be provided to health care professionals and will ensure that the vaccine will be correctly used in the different age and risk categories .
the chmp endorsed the new product information and agreed to finalise the article 20 procedure without any further regulatory action .
grounds for the variation of the marketing authorisation of hbvaxpro
whereas
the chmp is of the opinion that the product information of hbvaxpro , should be varied in order to maintain the safe and effective clinical use for the following reasons :
considering the data on low immunogenicity available today , the chmp identified the need for further studies to ensure long-term protection against hepatitis b with the current vaccine in future .
the use of this vaccine will not pose an immediate risk to any of the target groups the vaccine is indicated for .
potential remaining risks will be minimised to an acceptable level by the fundamentally revised spc .
the chmp considered that the benefit / risk balance of hbvaxpro concerning protection against hepatitis b virus infection caused by all known subtypes in all age categories considered at risk of exposure to hepatitis b virus remains favourable .

what is helicobacter test infai ?
helicobacter test infai is a diagnostic test .
it is available as a jar containing a powder to be made up into a solution for drinking .
the powder is the active substance 13c-urea ( 45 mg for children or 75 mg for adults ) .
what is helicobacter test infai used for ?
helicobacter test infai is used to diagnose helicobacter pylori infection in the stomach and duodenum ( the part of the gut just below the stomach ) .
h. pylori is a bacterium that is a factor in diseases such as dyspepsia ( heartburn , bloating and nausea ) , gastritis ( inflammation of the stomach ) , and peptic ulcer disease ( ulcers in the stomach or the duodenum ) .
helicobacter test infai can be used to test adults , adolescents who are likely to have peptic ulcer disease , and children aged three to 11 years .
it can only be used in children when invasive tests ( taking a sample from the stomach using a probe ) cannot be carried out or have given questionable results , or to check that h. pylori has been eliminated after a specific treatment to clear up the infection .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is helicobacter test infai used ?
helicobacter test infai is a breath test : breath samples are collected , which are then sent out for analysis to a specialised laboratory .
to carry out the test , the patient must collect four samples , two before taking helicobacter test infai and two thereafter .
the patient should not eat for at least six hours , preferably overnight , before taking the test .
firstly , the patient collects two breath samples , using the tubes or bags supplied with helicobacter test infai .
the patient then takes a test meal &apos; ( either 200 ml of pure orange juice or 1 g of citric acid dissolved in 200 ml water ) , followed by the solution of helicobacter test infai dissolved in water .
finally , 30 minutes after drinking the solution , the patient collects a further two breath samples .
in children aged three to 11 years , the test meal &apos;should be 100 ml of pure orange juice .
for full information on how the test is carried out , see the package leaflet .
when the patient takes helicobacter test infai , the 13c-urea contained in the test is broken down by h pylori into carbon dioxide that also contains 13c .
this labelled carbon dioxide can be measured by specialised laboratories using a technique called mass spectrometry .
if there is no labelled carbon dioxide in the breath , this means there are no bacteria in the stomach or duodenum .
how has helicobacter test infai been studied ?
helicobacter test infai has been tested in four studies in adult patients involving a total of 561 patients and one study in 335 children and adolescents .
all received 75 mg of 13c-urea , except 204 children under the age of 11 who received 45 mg .
one of the studies in adults was carried out in patients after they had received antibiotics to treat their infection .
what benefit has helicobacter test infai shown during the studies ?
in all studies , the results of the test done using helicobacter test infai agreed with the results obtained with the endoscopy and histology in over 95 of cases .
what is the risk associated with helicobacter test infai ?
there are no known side effects of the test .
however , if the patient vomits during the test , the test will need to be done again , but not until at least the following day .
why has helicobacter test infai been approved ?
the committee recommended that helicobacter test infai be given marketing authorisation .
other information about helicobacter test infai :

summary of product characteristics
name of the medicinal product
helicobacter test infai 75 mg powder for oral solution
qualitative and quantitative composition
one jar contains 75 mg of 13c-urea powder .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical form
powder for oral solution .
clear , colourless solution .
clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
helicobacter test infai may be used for in vivo diagnosis of gastroduodenal helicobacter pylori infection in :
- adults ,
- adolescents , who are likely to have peptic ulcer disease .
this medicinal product is for diagnostic use only .
posology and method of administration
this medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional and under appropriate medical supervision .
helicobacter test infai is a breath test for single administration .
patients from the age of 12 must take the content of 1 jar with 75 mg .
the patient must have fasted for over 6 hours , preferably overnight .
the test procedure takes approximately 40 minutes .
in case it is necessary to repeat the test procedure , this should not be done until the following day .
the suppression of helicobacter pylori might give false negative results .
therefore the test shall be used after at least four weeks without systemic antibacterial therapy and two weeks after last dose of acid antisecretory agents .
both might interfere with the helicobacter pylori status .
this is especially important after helicobacter eradication therapy .
it is important to follow the instructions for use adequately ( see section 6.6 ) , otherwise the reliability of the outcome will become questionable .
contraindications
the test must not be used in patients with documented or suspected gastric infection or atrophic gastritis , which might interfere with the urea breath test ( see section 4.2 ) .
special warnings and precautions for use
a positive test alone does not constitute indication for eradication therapy .
differential diagnosis with invasive endoscopic methods might be indicated in order to examine the presence of any other complicating conditions , e. g. ulcer , autoimmune gastritis and malignancies .
there is insufficient data on the diagnostic liability of the helicobacter test infai to recommend its use in patients with gastrectomy .
for children from the age of 3 , helicobacter test infai for children aged 3 to 11 is available .
in individual cases of a-gastritis ( atrophic gastritis ) the breath test may have false positive results ; other tests may be required to confirm the helicobacter pylori status .
if the patient vomits during the test procedure , necessitating the repetition of the test , this should be done in fasted condition and not before the following day ( see section 4.2 ) .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
helicobacter test infai will be affected by all treatments interfering with helicobacter pylori status or urease activity .
pregnancy and lactation
it is not expected that the test procedure may be harmful during pregnancy or lactation .
it is recommended to take notice of the product information of eradication therapy products for their use during pregnancy and lactation .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
helicobacter test infai has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
undesirable effects
none known .
overdose
due to the fact that only 75 mg of 13c-urea is delivered , an overdose is not expected .

the carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood vessels .
from there it is transported as bicarbonate into the lung and liberated as 13co2 with the exhaled air .
in the presence of bacterial urease the ratio of the 13c / 12c-carbon isotopes is significantly changed .
the portion of 13co2 in the breath samples is determined by isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry ( irms ) and stated as an absolute difference ( -value ) between the 00-minute- and the 30-minute-values .
urease is produced in the stomach only by helicobacter pylori .
other urease producing bacteria were seldom found in the gastric flora .

91.3 &#93; , and a specificity of 96.0 &#91; 90 -ci :
89.7 &#93; were achieved .
in the absence of bacterial urease , the whole amount of the administered urea after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract will be metabolised like the endogenous urea .
ammonia which is produced as described above by the bacterial hydrolysis is included into the metabolism as nh4 .
pharmacokinetic properties
the orally applied 13c-urea is metabolised to carbon dioxide and ammonia or is integrated into the body &apos;s own urea cycle .
any increase in 13co2 will be measured by isotopic analysis .
absorption and distribution of 13co2 is faster than the urease reaction .
therefore , the rate limiting step in the whole process is the cleavage of 13c-urea by helicobacter &apos;s urease .
only in helicobacter pylori- positive patients does the administration of 75 mg labelled urea lead to a significant increase of 13co2 in the breath sample within the first 30 minutes .

analysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories
the breath samples , collected in 10 ml glass- or plastic sample tubes , are analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry ( irms ) .
the analysis of the 13c / 12c-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test helicobacter test infai .
the accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath analysis .
the specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system .
it has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory .
the method validated in the application is as follows :
sample preparation for ( irms )
to determine the 13c / 12c-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon dioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer .
the automatic preparation system for isotope mass spectrometers which is dedicated for breath test analysis is based on a gas-chromatographic continuous flow separation technique .
water is removed from the sample by means of a nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic preparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with helium as eluent .
passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation detector .
the fraction of carbon dioxide gas , identified by its characteristic retention time , is introduced into mass spectrometer .
mass spectrometric analysis
to analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised , formed into a beam , accelerated by an electric field , deflected in a magnetic field , and finally detected .
these five processes take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer , which consists of three separate sections : the source , flight tube , and collector .
ionisation , beam formation and acceleration all occur in the source , magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector .
sample inlet
for introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available .
for breath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference standard gas is essential .
this ensures the high accuracy of this system , as calculation of the isotopic content in carbon dioxide is done with respect to an independent standard .
specifications for determining 13 c / 12c-ratios
the breath test concept relies on the administration of a specifically 13c-labelled urea whose metabolite utilisation is monitored by measuring 13co2 in the expired breath gas .
6 the mass spectrometer must be capable of :
multiple replicate analyses :
minimum of 3 replicate analyses on the same sample during operation
security access :
storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to avoid later manipulation 13
c / 12c-ratio with respect to pee dee beliminate ( pdb )
sample loop :
&lt; 200 l
the principal tests to verify the specifications are linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement .
all mass spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications :
0.5 for breath samples varying between 1 and 7 co2- concentration
0.3 for 13c at natural abundance using a 10 ml breath sample tube with 3 co2 breath concentration
helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13c / 12c of baseline-value and 30-minute- value exceeds 4.0 .
alternatively , any other suitable-validated method may be used , carried out by any objectively qualified laboratory .

the analysis of the 13c / 12c-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test helicobacter test infai .
the accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath analysis .
the specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system .
it has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory .
it is recommended to measure as soon as possible after the breath collection , in any case not later than 4 weeks .
the method validated in the application is as follows :
sample preparation for infrared spectroscopy ( ndir )
the determination of 13c / 12c-ratio in the carbon dioxide of the breath samples is carried out directly in the breath .
the breath from the bags will be introduced into the ndir spectrometer using a variable gas pump .
the water content of the breath sample will be kept mostly constant through nafion water trap .
for calibration and measurement necessary co2-free air ( zero-gas ) will be produced via an integrated co2-absorber in the analysator .
infrared spectroscopic analysis
to analyse the carbon dioxide in breath a broad band infrared radiation bunch emitted by an infrared radiation source is alternately sent through the measuring chamber and a reference chamber by means of a beam chopper .
the modulated infrared beams then enter the infrared detectors , which are double layer transmission detectors with a front , and a rear chamber each filled with one of the isotopicly pure gases ( 13co2 or 12co2 , respectively ) to be measured .
the infrared radiation in the measuring chamber is weakened by the gas component to be measured .
in consequence there is a temperature fluctuation , which in its turn causes a fluctuating pressure in the front chamber of the infrared detector .
a membrane capacitor connected with this chamber , which is exposed to a high resistance direct voltage , transforms these pressure fluctuations into an alternating voltage , which is a measure of the isotopic composition of breath carbon dioxide .
a semi-automatic sample inlet system injects the measuring gas in definite amounts into the zero gas circulating in the gas circuit of the infrared spectrometer .
this enables measurement of the 13c / 12c ratio at any co2 concentration above 1 .
specifications for determining 13c / 12c-ratios
the breath test concept is based upon the oral administration of 13c-labelled urea whose enzymatic hydrolysis is monitored by measuring 13co2 in breath using non-dispersive infrared spectrometry .
infrared spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications :
multiple replicate analyses :
minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation
storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to avoid later manipulation
for verifying the specifications linearity , stability , and precision of measurement have to be tested .
zero point adjustment of the detectors by means of the zero gas generated in the spectrometer .
helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13c / 12c of baseline-value and 30-minute- value exceeds 4.0 .
alternatively , any other suitable-validated method may be used , carried out by any objectively qualified laboratory .

specifications for determining 13c / 12c-ratios
the breath test concept relies on the administration of a specifically 13c-labelled urea whose metabolite utilisation is monitored by measuring 13co2 in the expired breath gas .
the mass spectrometer must be capable of :
multiple replicate analyses :
minimum of 3 replicate analyses on the same sample during operation
security access :
storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to avoid later manipulation
19 13 adjustment :
sample loop :
&lt; 200 l
the principle tests to verify the specifications are linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement .
all mass spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications :
helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13c / 12c of baseline-value and 30-minute- value exceeds 4.0 .
alternatively , any other suitable-validated method may be used , carried out by any objectively qualified laboratory .

further information
what helicobacter test infai is and what it is used for
helicobacter test infai is for diagnostic use only .
helicobacter test infai is a breath test that can be used for adolescents from the age of 12 and older and adults to determine whether or not you have an infection in the stomach caused by the bacterium helicobacter pylori .
why do you need to take the helicobacter test infai ?
you may have a gastric infection caused by a bacterium called helicobacter pylori .
your doctor has recommended that you have a helicobacter test infai for one of the following reasons :
your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from helicobacter pylori infection to help diagnose your condition .
you have already been diagnosed as being infected with helicobacter pylori and have been taking medication aimed to clear up the infection .
your doctor now wishes to find out if the treatment has been successful .
how does the test work ?
all foods contain a substance called 13carbon ( 1 13c ) .
this 13carbon can be detected in the carbon dioxide you breathe out of your lungs .
the actual amount of 13carbon in the breath will depend on the kind of food that you have eaten .
following the meal , samples of your breath will be taken ( see &quot; special instructions for use &quot; ) .
these samples will be analysed to measure the &quot; normal &quot; amount of 13carbon content in the carbon dioxide in your breath .
you will then be asked to drink a solution of 13carbon-urea .
further samples of your breath will then be taken 30 minutes later and the amount of 13carbon in the samples measured as before .
the results will be compared and a significant increase in the amount of 13 carbon in the second set of samples will suggest your doctor that helicobacter pylori are present .
before you take helicobacter test infai
please tell your doctor if you suffer from any medical condition that you think may affect , or be affected by the test .
it is also important that you tell your doctor if any of the following circumstances apply to you :
- if you have or if it is suspected that you have a gastric infection or an atropic gastritis ( special
take special care with helicobacter test infai even if the result of helicobacter test infai is positive , further tests might be necessary before a treatment of a helicobacter pylori infection ( eradication therapy ) may be started .
various diagnostic tests , including invasive endoscopic tests , could be required to check for the presence of any other complications , such as gastric ulcer , infection of the gastric mucosa caused by an autoimmune reaction , and tumours .
there is insufficient data on the diagnostic reliability of the helicobacter test infai for recommending its use in patients with gastrectomy .
results ; other tests may therefore be necessary to confirm the presence of helicobacter pylori .
- if the patient vomits during the test procedure , necessitating the repetition of the test , this should
be done in fasted condition and not before the following day .
taking other medicines helicobacter test infai is influenced by all medicines related to helicobacter pylori or urease activity .
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
pregnancy and breast-feeding ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
it is not expected that performing the breath test during pregnancy and lactation has a damaging effect .
if you are a patient taking a medicine for eradication therapy it is recommended to check the patient information leaflet of that drug with respect to the details on pregnancy and lactation .
driving and using machines helicobacter test infai has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines .
how to take helicobacter test infai
always take helicobacter test infai exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure .
you should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person .
dosage the following information applies , unless your doctor has otherwise prescribed helicobacter test infai .
please follow the instructions for use , as otherwise the helicobacter test infai may not work properly .
38 how much helicobacter test infai should be used and how often ?
patients from the age of 12 must take the content of one jar with 75 mg for one test .
how and when should helicobacter test infai be used ?
if fasting is a problem , for example for diabetic patients , please tell your doctor .
the test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes .
the test should be performed following at least four weeks without antibacterial therapy and two weeks after the last administration of an antisecretory medication .
both of these substances could influence the results of the helicobacter test infai .
this is particularly true after helicobacter eradication therapy .
it is important to follow the instructions for use exactly , otherwise the result may be questionable .
essential items not supplied with helicobacter test infai before the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay stomach emptying .
the test meal is not provided with the kit .
pure orange juice ( 200 ml ) or a solution of citric acid ( 1 g in 200 ml of water ) can be used as a test meal .
if there is a medical ( or other ) reason why you cannot take either of these test meals , please tell your doctor , who will suggest an alternative .
a drinking vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13c-urea powder .
if the test needs to be repeated , this should not be done until the following day .
special instructions for use ( for mass spectrometry ) the test is to be performed after instruction by a healthcare professional and under appropriate medical supervision .
each patient should be documented using the provided data sheet .
it is recommended that you take the test in a resting position .
the test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application , preferably overnight .
if the test needs to be carried out later in the day , only a light meal like tea and toast is recommended .
now the second sample container ( labelled &quot; sampling time :
00-minute-value &quot; ) has to be filled up with breath in the same way as described above .
now the preparation of the test solution follows .
30-minute- value &quot; ) as described under points 3 and 4 .
the bar-code labels marked &quot; 30-minute-value &quot; must be used for these samples .
the corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation .
all breath samples containers should be placed back into the original packaging .
this packaging should be sealed with the remaining sticker .
the package must be sent to a qualified laboratory for analysis .
if you take more helicobacter test infai than you should because only 75 mg 13c-urea is provided overdose is not to be expected .
possible side effects
no side effects are known .

analysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories
the breath samples , collected in 10 l glass , plastic sample tubes are analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry ( irms ) .
the specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system .
it has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory .
the method validated in the application is as follows :
sample preparation for ( irms )
to determine the 13c / 12c-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon dioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer .
the automatic preparation system for isotope mass spectrometers which is dedicated for breath test analysis is based on a gas-chromatographic continuous flow separation technique .
water is removed from the sample by means of a nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic preparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with helium as eluent .
passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation detector .
the fraction of carbon dioxide gas , identified by its characteristic retention time , is introduced into mass spectrometer .
mass spectrometric analysis
to analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised , formed into a beam , accelerated by an electric field , deflected in a magnetic field , and finally detected .
these five processes take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer , which consists of three separate sections : the source , flight tube , and collector .
ionisation , beam formation and acceleration all occur in the source , magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector .
sample inlet
for introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available .
for breath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference standard gas is essential .
this ensures the high accuracy of this system , as calculation of the isotopic content in carbon dioxide is done with respect to an independent standard .

analysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories
the breath samples , collected in breath bags are analysed by non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy ( ndir ) .
53 the analysis of the 13c / 12c-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test helicobacter test infai .
the accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath analysis .
the specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system .
it has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory .
it is recommended to measure as soon as possible after the breath collection , in any case not later than 4 weeks .
the method validated in the application is as follows :
sample preparation for infrared spectroscopy ( ndir )
the determination of 13c / 12c-ratio in the carbon dioxide of the breath samples is carried out directly in the breath .
the breath from the bags will be introduced into the ndir spectrometer using a variable gas pump .
the water content of the breath sample will be kept mostly constant through nafion water trap .
for calibration and measurement necessary co2-free air ( zero-gas ) will be produced via an integrated co2-absorber in the analysator .
infrared spectroscopic analysis
to analyse the carbon dioxide in breath a broad band infrared radiation bunch emitted by an infrared radiation source is alternately sent through the measuring chamber and a reference chamber by means of a beam chopper .
the modulated infrared beams then enter the infrared detectors , which are double layer transmission detectors with a front , and a rear chamber each filled with one of the isotopicly pure gases ( 13co2 or 12co2 , respectively ) to be measured .
the infrared radiation in the measuring chamber is weakened by the gas component to be measured .
in consequence there is a temperature fluctuation , which in its turn causes a fluctuating pressure in the front chamber of the infrared detector .
a membrane capacitor connected with this chamber , which is exposed to a high resistance direct voltage , transforms these pressure fluctuations into an alternating voltage , which is a measure of the isotopic composition of breath carbon dioxide .
sample inlet
a semi-automatic sample inlet system injects the measuring gas in definite amounts into the zero gas circulating in the gas circuit of the infrared spectrometer .
this enables measurement of the 13c / 12c ratio at any co2 concentration above 1 .
specifications for determining 13c / 12c-ratios
the breath test concept is based upon the oral administration of 13c-labelled urea whose enzymatic hydrolysis is monitored by measuring 13co2 in breath using non-dispersive infrared spectrometry .
infrared spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications :
multiple replicate analyses :
minimum of 3 replicate analyses of one and the same sample during operation
storing of operating parameters and results under security access to avoid later manipulation
for verifying the specifications linearity , stability , and precision of measurement have to be tested .
zero point adjustment of the detectors by means of the zero gas generated in the spectrometer .
end- point adjustment of the detectors by means of calibration gases of precisely known concentration .
linearity :
0.5 for 13c at natural abundance using a 100 ml breath bag with 3 co2 breath concentration
helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13c / 12c of baseline-value and 30-minute- value exceeds 4.0 .
alternatively , any other suitably validated method may be used , carried out by any objectively qualified laboratory .

what helicobacter test infai for children aged 3 to 11 years is and what it is used for
helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 is for diagnostic use only .
why do you need to take the helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 ?
you may have a gastric infection caused by a bacterium called helicobacter pylori .
your doctor has recommended that you have a helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 for one of the following reasons :
your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from helicobacter pylori infection to help diagnose your condition .
you have already been diagnosed has being infected with helicobacter pylori and have been taking medication aimed to clear up the infection .
your doctor now wishes to find out if the treatment has been successful .
how does the test work ?
all foods contain a substance called 13carbon ( 1 13c ) .
this 13carbon can be detected in the carbon dioxide you breathe out of your lungs .
the actual amount of 13carbon in the breath will depend on the kind of food that you have eaten .
following the meal , samples of your breath will be taken ( see &quot; special instructions for use &quot; ) .
these samples will be analysed to measure the &quot; normal &quot; amount of 13carbon content in the carbon dioxide in your breath .
you will then be asked to drink a solution of 13carbon-urea .
further samples of your breath will then be taken 30 minutes later and the amount of 13carbon in the samples measured as before .
the results will be compared and a significant increase in the amount of 13 carbon in the second set of samples will suggest your doctor that helicobacter pylori are present .
before you t ake helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11
please tell your doctor if you suffer from any medical condition that you think may affect , or be affected by the test .
it is also important that you tell your doctor if any of the following circumstances apply to you :
do not take helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11
- if you have or if it is suspected that you have a gastric infection or an atrophic gastritis ( special
form of gastritits ) , because this might interfere with the urea breath test .
take special care with helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 even if the result of helicobacter test infai is positive , further tests might be necessary before a treatment of a helicobacter pylori infection ( eradication therapy ) may be started .
various diagnostic tests , including invasive endoscopic tests , could be required to check for the presence of any other complications , such as gastric ulcer , infection of the gastric mucosa caused by an autoimmune reaction , and tumours .
there is insufficient data on the diagnostic reliability of the helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 for recommending its use in patients with gastrectomy .
results ; other tests may therefore be necessary to confirm the presence of helicobacter pylori .
- if the patient vomits during the test procedure , necessitating the repetition of the test , this should
be done in fasted condition and not before the following day .
taking other medicines helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 is influenced by all medicines related to helicobacter pylori or urease activity .
please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
how to take helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11
you should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person .
dosage the following information applies , unless your doctor has otherwise prescribed helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 .
please follow the instructions for use , as otherwise the helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 years may not work properly .
how much helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 should be used and how often ?
patients from the age of 3-11 must take the content of one jar with 45 mg for one test .
how and when should helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 be used ?
if fasting is a problem , for example for diabetic patients , please tell your doctor .
the test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes .
58 the test should be performed following at least four weeks without antibacterial therapy and two weeks after the last administration of an antisecretory medication .
both of these substances could influence the results of the helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 .
this is particularly true after helicobacter eradication therapy .
it is important to follow the instructions for use exactly , otherwise the result may be questionable .
essential items not supplied with helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 before the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay stomach emptying .
the test meal is not provided with the kit .
pure orange juice ( 100 ml ) can be used as a test meal .
if there is a medical ( or other ) reason why you cannot take either of these test meals , please tell your doctor , who will suggest an alternative .
a drinking vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13c-urea powder .
if the test needs to be repeated , this should not be done until the following day .
each patient should be documented using the provided data sheet .
it is recommended that you take the test in a resting position .
the test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application , preferably overnight .
if the test needs to be carried out later in the day , only a light meal like tea and toast is recommended .
now the second sample container ( labelled &quot; sampling time :
00-minute-value &quot; ) has to be filled up with breath in the same way as described above .
then the patient must drink the recommended test meal ( 100 ml 100 orange juice ) .
the patient should drink this test solution immediately .
the time of intake must be noted .
minutes after the test solution has been taken ( point 6 ) , the &quot; 30-minute-value &quot; samples are collected in both containers , which remains in the pack ( labelled &quot; sampling time :
the bar-code labels marked &quot; 30-minute-value &quot; must be used for these samples .
the corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation .
all breath samples containers should be placed back into the original packaging .
this packaging should be sealed with the remaining sticker .
the package must be sent to a qualified laboratory for analysis .
if you take more helicobacter test infai for children of the age 3-11 than you should because only 45 mg 13c-urea is provided overdose is not to be expected .

analysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories
the breath samples , collected in 10 ml glass- or plastic sample tubes , are analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry ( irms ) .
62 the analysis of the 13c / 12c-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test helicobacter test infai .
the accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath analysis .
the specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system .
it has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory .
the method validated in the application is as follows :
sample preparation for ( irms )
to determine the 13c / 12c-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon dioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer .
water is removed from the sample by means of a nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic preparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with helium as eluent .
passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation detector .
the fraction of carbon dioxide gas , identified by its characteristic retention time , is introduced into mass spectrometer .
mass spectrometric analysis
to analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised , formed into a beam , accelerated by an electric field , deflected in a magnetic field , and finally detected .
these five processes take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer , which consists of three separate sections : the source , flight tube , and collector .
ionisation , beam formation and acceleration all occur in the source , magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector .
sample inlet
for breath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference standard gas is essential .
this ensures the high accuracy of this system , as calculation of the isotopic content in carbon dioxide is done with respect to an independent standard .
specifications for determining 13c / 12c-ratios
the breath test concept relies on the administration of a specifically 13c-labelled urea whose metabolite utilisation is monitored by measuring 13co2 in the expired breath gas .
the mass spectrometer must be capable of :
multiple replicate analyses :
minimum of 3 replicate analyses on the same sample during operation
storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to avoid later manipulation 13
c / 12c-ratio with respect to pee dee beliminate ( pdb )
the principle tests to verify the specifications are linearity , stability ( reference gas precision ) , and precision of measurement .
all mass spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications :
linearity :
0.2 on 10 consecutive pulses
helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13c / 12c of baseline-value and 30-minute- value exceeds 4.0 .
alternatively , any other suitable-validated method may be used , carried out by any objectively qualified laboratory .

what is helixate nexgen ?
helixate nexgen is a powder and solvent that are mixed together to make a solution for injection .
helixate nexgen contains the active substance octocog alfa ( recombinant coagulation factor viii ) .
what is helixate nexgen used for ?
helixate nexgen is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a ( an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor viii ) .
helixate nexgen is intended for either short-term or long-term use .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is helixate nexgen used ?
helixate nexgen should be started by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of haemophilia .
helixate nexgen is given by intravenous injection ( into a vein ) over several minutes , up to a rate of 2 ml per minute .
the dose and frequency depend on whether helixate nexgen is used to treat haemorrhage ( bleeding ) or prevent it during surgery .
the dose is also adjusted depending on the severity of the haemorrhage or the type of surgery .
helixate nexgen can also be given as a continuous infusion ( drip into a vein ) for at least seven days in patients undergoing major surgery .
full details on how to calculate the doses are included in the package leaflet .
how does helixate nexgen work ?
the active substance in helixate nexgen , octocog alfa , is a blood coagulation factor protein .
in the body , factor viii is one of the substances ( factors ) involved in blood coagulation ( clotting ) .
patients with haemophilia a lack factor viii , and this causes blood coagulation problems , such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
helixate nexgen is used to replace the missing factor viii .
it corrects the factor viii deficiency and gives temporary control of the bleeding disorder .
octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method known as recombinant dna technology : it is made by a cell that has received a gene ( dna ) , which makes it able to produce human coagulation factor viii .
helixate 7 westferry circus , canary wharf , london e14 4hb , uk tel .
the main measure of effectiveness in the studies was the number of treatments required to stop each new bleed .
helixate nexgen has also been studied as a continuous infusion in 15 patients with haemophilia a undergoing major surgery .
the main measure of effectiveness was the doctor &apos;s assessment of how well bleeding was stopped .
what benefit has helixate nexgen shown during the studies ?
in the previously treated patients , overall , 95 of bleeds responded to one or two intravenous injections of helixate nexgen .
in the previously untreated patients , about 90 of bleeding episodes responded to treatment with one or two intravenous injections .
when given as a continuous infusion , stopping bleeding was assessed as excellent &apos; in all 15 patients .
what is the risk associated with helixate nexgen ?
haemophilia a patients may develop antibodies ( inhibitors ) to factor viii .
an antibody is a protein produced by the body in reaction to unknown agents as part of the natural defence system of the body .
however , it is seen in less than 0.2 of patients treated for more than 100 days .
if antibodies develop , helixate nexgen will not work effectively .
hypersensitivity ( allergic reactions ) has sometimes been seen in patients treated with factor viii-containing products .
helixate nexgen should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to recombinant coagulation factor viii , to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients .
why has helixate nexgen been approved ?
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) decided that helixate nexgen &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a ( congenital factor viii deficiency ) .
the committee recommended that helixate nexgen be given marketing authorisation .
other information about helixate nexgen :
the european commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the european union for helixate nexgen on 4 august 2000 .
the marketing authorisation was renewed on 4 august 2005 .
the marketing authorisation holder is bayer healthcare ag .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a ( congenital factor viii deficiency ) .
this preparation does not contain von willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von willebrand &apos;s disease .
posology and method of administration
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
posology the number of units of factor viii administered is expressed in international units ( iu ) , which are related to the current who standard for factor viii products .
factor viii activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in international units ( relative to the international standard for factor viii in plasma ) .
one international unit ( iu ) of factor viii activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor viii in one ml of normal human plasma .
the calculation of the required dosage of factor viii is based on the empirical finding that 1 international unit ( iu ) factor viii per kg body weight raises the plasma factor viii activity by 1.5 to 2.5 of normal activity .
the required dosage is determined using the following formulae :
2 i.
required iu = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor viii rise ( of normal ) x 0.5
2 x administered iu body weight ( kg )
the dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient &apos;s needs ( weight , severity of disorder of the haemostatic function , the site and extent of the bleeding , the titre of inhibitors , and the factor viii level desired ) .
the following table provides a guide for factor viii minimum blood levels .
in the case of the haemorrhagic events listed , the factor viii activity should not fall below the given level ( in of normal ) in the corresponding period :
degree of haemorrhage / type of surgical procedure haemorrhage
factor viii level required ( ) ( iu / dl )
frequency of doses ( hours ) / duration of therapy ( days )
early haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or oral bleed
at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved .
more extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or haematoma
repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved .
life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed , throat bleed , severe abdominal bleed surgery
repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
minor including tooth extraction
every 24 hours , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
major
- 100 ( pre- and
a ) by bolus infusions repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative )
the amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case .
under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required , especially in the case of the initial dose .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of factor viii levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions .
in the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis ( plasma factor viii activity ) is indispensable .
individual patients may vary in
it has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia a patients who undergo a major surgery that helixate nexgen can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries ( pre- , during and postoperative ) .
in this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions .
helixate nexgen contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient , which is known to increase the rate of di- ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) materials .
this should be considered for a continuous infusion administration .
for scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia a , doses of 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days .
in some cases , especially in younger patients , shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary .
data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age .
patients with inhibitors
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii inhibitors .
if the expected plasma factor viii activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor viii inhibitor is present .
if the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 bethesda units ( bu ) per ml , administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor viii may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with helixate nexgen .
however , in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor viii activity .
in patients with inhibitor titres above 10 bu or with high anamnestic response , the use of ( activated ) prothrombin complex concentrate ( pcc ) or recombinant activated factor vii ( rfviia ) preparations has to be considered .
these therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia .
administration dissolve the preparation as described in section 6.6 .
helixate nexgen should be injected intravenously over several minutes .
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient &apos;s comfort level ( maximal rate of infusion :
helixate nexgen can be infused by continuous infusion .
the infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired fviii level .
example : for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate would be 3 iu / h / kg to achieve a fviii level of 100 .
for calculation of ml / hour , multiply infusion rate in iu / h / kg by kg bw / concentration of solution ( iu / ml ) .
clearance :
desired plasma fviii level
infusion rate iu / h / kg
infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml / h concentrations of rfviii solution 100 iu / ml 200 iu / ml 400 iu / ml
( 1 iu / ml ) 60 ( 0.6 iu / ml ) 40 ( 0.4 iu / ml )
higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions .
subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual fviii levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation : clearance = infusion rate / actual fviii level .
contraindications
known hypersensitivity to the active substance , to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients .
special warnings and precautions for use
as with any intravenous protein product , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness , dizziness , mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions .
symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate .
if allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur , the injection / infusion should be stopped immediately and patients should contact their physician .
in case of shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed .
the formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) to factor viii is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia a.
these inhibitors are invariably igg immunoglobulins directed against the factor viii procoagulant activity , which are quantified in modified bethesda units ( bu ) per ml of plasma .
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor viii and to genetic factors among others , this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days .
rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days .
cases of recurrence of inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor viii product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor viii should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects .
in a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries , heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions .
in the interest of the patients , it is recommended that , whenever possible , every time that helixate nexgen is administered to them , the name and the batch number of the product is registered .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium free &quot; .
interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no interactions of helixate nexgen with other medicinal products are known .
pregnancy and lactation
animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with helixate nexgen .
based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia a in women , experience regarding the use of helixate nexgen during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available .
therefore , helixate nexgen should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
effects on ability to drive or use machines
helixate nexgen has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines .
undesirable effects
after administration of helixate nexgen mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table .
5 meddra system organ class blood and lymphatic sytem disorders gastrointestinal disorders

the formation of neutralising antibodies to factor viii ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia a.
in studies with recombinant factor viii preparations , development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs .
patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
in clinical studies , helixate nexgen has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients ( pups ) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients ( mtps , defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days ) .
five out of 37 ( 14 ) pup and 4 out of 23 ( 17 ) mtp patients treated with helixate nexgen developed inhibitors :
overall 6 out of 60 ( 10 ) with a titer above 10 bu and 3 out of 60 ( 5 ) with a titer below 10 bu .
the median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days ( range 3 - 18 days ) .
4-478 ) .
four of the five patients , who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study , ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor .
the fifth patient was lost to follow-up .
in clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients ( ptp , defined as having more than 100 exposure days ) , followed over four years , no de-novo inhibitors were observed .
less than 0.2 ptp developed de-novo inhibitors .
in a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry , less than 11 developed de-novo inhibitors .
during studies , no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation .
however , the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents , e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) .
overdose
no symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor viii have been reported .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : blood coagulation factor viii , atc-code b02b d02 .
6 the factor viii / von willebrand factor ( vwf ) complex consists of two molecules ( factor viii and vwf ) with different physiological functions .
when infused into a haemophiliac patient , factor viii binds to vwf in the patient &apos;s circulation .
activated factor viii acts as a cofactor for activated factor ix , accelerating the conversion of factor x to activated factor x.
activated factor x converts prothrombin into thrombin .
thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
haemophilia a is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor viii : c and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma .
by replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor viii are increased , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies .
determination of activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor viii .
the aptt is prolonged in all haemophiliacs .
the degree and duration of aptt normalisation observed after administration of helixate nexgen is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor viii .
pharmacokinetic properties
the analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2 per iu / kg body weight for helixate nexgen .
this result is similar to the reported values for factor viii derived from human plasma .
after administration of helixate nexgen , peak factor viii activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours .
13 hours .
preclinical safety data
even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose ( related to body weight ) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for helixate nexgen in laboratory animals ( mouse , rat , rabbit , and dog ) .
specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity , chronic toxicity , and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species .
no studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of helixate nexgen , since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of helixate nexgen .

clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a ( congenital factor viii deficiency ) .
this preparation does not contain von willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von willebrand &apos;s disease .
posology and method of administration
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
posology the number of units of factor viii administered is expressed in international units ( iu ) , which are related to the current who standard for factor viii products .
factor viii activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in international units ( relative to the international standard for factor viii in plasma ) .
one international unit ( iu ) of factor viii activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor viii in one ml of normal human plasma .
the calculation of the required dosage of factor viii is based on the empirical finding that 1 international unit ( iu ) factor viii per kg body weight raises the plasma factor viii activity by 1.5 to 2.5 of normal activity .
the required dosage is determined using the following formulae :
10 i.
required iu = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor viii rise ( of normal ) x 0.5
2 x administered iu body weight ( kg )
the dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient &apos;s needs ( weight , severity of disorder of the haemostatic function , the site and extent of the bleeding , the titre of inhibitors , and the factor viii level desired ) .
the following table provides a guide for factor viii minimum blood levels .
in the case of the haemorrhagic events listed , the factor viii activity should not fall below the given level ( in of normal ) in the corresponding period :
degree of haemorrhage / type of surgical procedure haemorrhage
factor viii level required ( ) ( iu / dl )
frequency of doses ( hours ) / duration of therapy ( days )
early haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or oral bleed
at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved .
more extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or haematoma
repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved .
life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed , throat bleed , severe abdominal bleed surgery
repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
minor including tooth extraction
every 24 hours , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
major
- 100 ( pre- and
a ) by bolus infusions repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative )
the amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case .
under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required , especially in the case of the initial dose .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of factor viii levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions .
in the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis ( plasma factor viii activity ) is indispensable .
individual patients may vary in
it has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia a patients who undergo a major surgery that helixate nexgen can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries ( pre- , during and postoperative ) .
in this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions .
helixate nexgen contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient , which is known to increase the rate of di- ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) materials .
this should be considered for a continuous infusion administration .
for scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia a , doses of 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days .
in some cases , especially in younger patients , shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary .
data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age .
patients with inhibitors
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii inhibitors .
if the expected plasma factor viii activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor viii inhibitor is present .
if the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 bethesda units ( bu ) per ml , administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor viii may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with helixate nexgen .
however , in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor viii activity .
in patients with inhibitor titres above 10 bu or with high anamnestic response , the use of ( activated ) prothrombin complex concentrate ( pcc ) or recombinant activated factor vii ( rfviia ) preparations has to be considered .
these therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia .
administration dissolve the preparation as described in section 6.6 .
helixate nexgen should be injected intravenously over several minutes .
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient &apos;s comfort level ( maximal rate of infusion :
helixate nexgen can be infused by continuous infusion .
the infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired fviii level .
example : for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate would be 3 iu / h / kg to achieve a fviii level of 100 .
for calculation of ml / hour , multiply infusion rate in iu / h / kg by kg bw / concentration of solution ( iu / ml ) .
clearance :
desired plasma fviii level
infusion rate iu / h / kg
infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml / h concentrations of rfviii solution 100 iu / ml 200 iu / ml 400 iu / ml
( 1 iu / ml ) 60 ( 0.6 iu / ml ) 40 ( 0.4 iu / ml )
higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions .
subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual fviii levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation : clearance = infusion rate / actual fviii level .
contraindications
known hypersensitivity to the active substance , to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients .
special warnings and precautions for use
as with any intravenous protein product , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness , dizziness , mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions .
symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate .
if allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur , the injection / infusion should be stopped immediately and patients should contact their physician .
in case of shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed .
the formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) to factor viii is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia a.
these inhibitors are invariably igg immunoglobulins directed against the factor viii procoagulant activity , which are quantified in modified bethesda units ( bu ) per ml of plasma .
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor viii and to genetic factors among others , this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days .
rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days .
cases of recurrence of inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor viii product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor viii should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects .
in a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries , heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions .
in the interest of the patients , it is recommended that , whenever possible , every time that helixate nexgen is administered to them , the name and the batch number of the product is registered .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium free &quot; .
interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no interactions of helixate nexgen with other medicinal products are known .
pregnancy and lactation
animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with helixate nexgen .
based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia a in women , experience regarding the use of helixate nexgen during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available .
therefore , helixate nexgen should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
effects on ability to drive or use machines
helixate nexgen has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines .
undesirable effects
after administration of helixate nexgen mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table .

the formation of neutralising antibodies to factor viii ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia a.
in studies with recombinant factor viii preparations , development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs .
patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
in clinical studies , helixate nexgen has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients ( pups ) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients ( mtps , defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days ) .
five out of 37 ( 14 ) pup and 4 out of 23 ( 17 ) mtp patients treated with helixate nexgen developed inhibitors :
overall 6 out of 60 ( 10 ) with a titer above 10 bu and 3 out of 60 ( 5 ) with a titer below 10 bu .
the median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days ( range 3 - 18 days ) .
4-478 ) .
four of the five patients , who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study , ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor .
the fifth patient was lost to follow-up .
in clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients ( ptp , defined as having more than 100 exposure days ) , followed over four years , no de-novo inhibitors were observed .
less than 0.2 ptp developed de-novo inhibitors .
in a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry , less than 11 developed de-novo inhibitors .
during studies , no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation .
however , the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents , e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) .
overdose
no symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor viii have been reported .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : blood coagulation factor viii , atc-code b02b d02 .
14 the factor viii / von willebrand factor ( vwf ) complex consists of two molecules ( factor viii and vwf ) with different physiological functions .
when infused into a haemophiliac patient , factor viii binds to vwf in the patient &apos;s circulation .
activated factor viii acts as a cofactor for activated factor ix , accelerating the conversion of factor x to activated factor x.
activated factor x converts prothrombin into thrombin .
thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
haemophilia a is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor viii : c and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma .
by replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor viii are increased , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies .
determination of activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor viii .
the aptt is prolonged in all haemophiliacs .
the degree and duration of aptt normalisation observed after administration of helixate nexgen is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor viii .
pharmacokinetic properties
the analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2 per iu / kg body weight for helixate nexgen .
this result is similar to the reported values for factor viii derived from human plasma .
after administration of helixate nexgen , peak factor viii activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours .
13 hours .
preclinical safety data
even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose ( related to body weight ) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for helixate nexgen in laboratory animals ( mouse , rat , rabbit , and dog ) .
specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity , chronic toxicity , and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species .
no studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of helixate nexgen , since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of helixate nexgen .

the solvent is water for injections provided in a vial .
clinical particulars
therapeutic indications
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia a ( congenital factor viii deficiency ) .
this preparation does not contain von willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von willebrand &apos;s disease .
posology and method of administration
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
posology the number of units of factor viii administered is expressed in international units ( iu ) , which are related to the current who standard for factor viii products .
factor viii activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in international units ( relative to the international standard for factor viii in plasma ) .
one international unit ( iu ) of factor viii activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor viii in one ml of normal human plasma .
the calculation of the required dosage of factor viii is based on the empirical finding that 1 international unit ( iu ) factor viii per kg body weight raises the plasma factor viii activity by 1.5 to 2.5 of normal activity .
the required dosage is determined using the following formulae :
26 i.
required iu = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor viii rise ( of normal ) x 0.5
2 x administered iu body weight ( kg )
the dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient &apos;s needs ( weight , severity of disorder of the haemostatic function , the site and extent of the bleeding , the titre of inhibitors , and the factor viii level desired ) .
the following table provides a guide for factor viii minimum blood levels .
in the case of the haemorrhagic events listed , the factor viii activity should not fall below the given level ( in of normal ) in the corresponding period :
degree of haemorrhage / type of surgical procedure haemorrhage
factor viii level required ( ) ( iu / dl )
frequency of doses ( hours ) / duration of therapy ( days )
early haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or oral bleed
at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved .
more extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or haematoma
repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved .
life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed , throat bleed , severe abdominal bleed surgery
repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
minor including tooth extraction
every 24 hours , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
major
- 100 ( pre- and
a ) by bolus infusions repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative )
the amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case .
under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required , especially in the case of the initial dose .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of factor viii levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions .
in the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis ( plasma factor viii activity ) is indispensable .
individual patients may vary in
it has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia a patients who undergo a major surgery that helixate nexgen can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries ( pre- , during and postoperative ) .
in this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions .
helixate nexgen contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient , which is known to increase the rate of di- ( 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) materials .
this should be considered for a continuous infusion administration .
for scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia a , doses of 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days .
in some cases , especially in younger patients , shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary .
data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age .
patients with inhibitors
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii inhibitors .
if the expected plasma factor viii activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor viii inhibitor is present .
if the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 bethesda units ( bu ) per ml , administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor viii may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with helixate nexgen .
however , in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor viii activity .
in patients with inhibitor titres above 10 bu or with high anamnestic response , the use of ( activated ) prothrombin complex concentrate ( pcc ) or recombinant activated factor vii ( rfviia ) preparations has to be considered .
these therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia .
administration dissolve the preparation as described in section 6.6 .
helixate nexgen should be injected intravenously over several minutes .
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient &apos;s comfort level ( maximal rate of infusion :
helixate nexgen can be infused by continuous infusion .
the infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired fviii level .
example : for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate would be 3 iu / h / kg to achieve a fviii level of 100 .
for calculation of ml / hour , multiply infusion rate in iu / h / kg by kg bw / concentration of solution ( iu / ml ) .
clearance :
desired plasma fviii level
infusion rate iu / h / kg
infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml / h concentrations of rfviii solution 100 iu / ml 200 iu / ml 400 iu / ml
( 1 iu / ml ) 60 ( 0.6 iu / ml ) 40 ( 0.4 iu / ml )
higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions .
subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual fviii levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation : clearance = infusion rate / actual fviii level .
contraindications
known hypersensitivity to the active substance , to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients .
special warnings and precautions for use
as with any intravenous protein product , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness , dizziness , mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions .
symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate .
if allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur , the injection / infusion should be stopped immediately and patients should contact their physician .
in case of shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed .
the formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) to factor viii is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia a.
these inhibitors are invariably igg immunoglobulins directed against the factor viii procoagulant activity , which are quantified in modified bethesda units ( bu ) per ml of plasma .
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor viii and to genetic factors among others , this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days .
rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days .
cases of recurrence of inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor viii product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor viii should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects .
in a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries , heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions .
in the interest of the patients , it is recommended that , whenever possible , every time that helixate nexgen is administered to them , the name and the batch number of the product is registered .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium free &quot; .
interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no interactions of helixate nexgen with other medicinal products are known .
pregnancy and lactation
animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with helixate nexgen .
based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia a in women , experience regarding the use of helixate nexgen during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available .
therefore , helixate nexgen should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
effects on ability to drive or use machines
helixate nexgen has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines .
undesirable effects
after administration of helixate nexgen mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table .
29 meddra system organ class blood and lymphatic sytem disorders gastrointestinal disorders

the formation of neutralising antibodies to factor viii ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia a.
in studies with recombinant factor viii preparations , development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs .
patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
in clinical studies , helixate nexgen has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients ( pups ) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients ( mtps , defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days ) .
five out of 37 ( 14 ) pup and 4 out of 23 ( 17 ) mtp patients treated with helixate nexgen developed inhibitors :
overall 6 out of 60 ( 10 ) with a titer above 10 bu and 3 out of 60 ( 5 ) with a titer below 10 bu .
the median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days ( range 3 - 18 days ) .
4-478 ) .
four of the five patients , who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study , ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor .
the fifth patient was lost to follow-up .
in clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients ( ptp , defined as having more than 100 exposure days ) , followed over four years , no de-novo inhibitors were observed .
less than 0.2 ptp developed de-novo inhibitors .
in a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry , less than 11 developed de-novo inhibitors .
during studies , no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation .
however , the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents , e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) .
overdose
no symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor viii have been reported .
pharmacological properties
pharmacodynamic properties
pharmacotherapeutic group : blood coagulation factor viii , atc-code b02b d02 .
30 the factor viii / von willebrand factor ( vwf ) complex consists of two molecules ( factor viii and vwf ) with different physiological functions .
when infused into a haemophiliac patient , factor viii binds to vwf in the patient &apos;s circulation .
activated factor viii acts as a cofactor for activated factor ix , accelerating the conversion of factor x to activated factor x.
activated factor x converts prothrombin into thrombin .
thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
haemophilia a is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor viii : c and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma .
by replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor viii are increased , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies .
determination of activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor viii .
the aptt is prolonged in all haemophiliacs .
the degree and duration of aptt normalisation observed after administration of helixate nexgen is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor viii .
pharmacokinetic properties
the analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2 per iu / kg body weight for helixate nexgen .
this result is similar to the reported values for factor viii derived from human plasma .
after administration of helixate nexgen , peak factor viii activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours .
13 hours .
preclinical safety data
even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose ( related to body weight ) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for helixate nexgen in laboratory animals ( mouse , rat , rabbit , and dog ) .
specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity , chronic toxicity , and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species .
no studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of helixate nexgen , since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of helixate nexgen .
