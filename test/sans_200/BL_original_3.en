what is Circovac ?
Circovac is a vaccine for use in pigs .
it comes in two vials , one containing a suspension and the other containing an emulsion , and these need to be mixed before injection .
Circovac contains an inactivated porcine circovirus type 2 ( PCV2 ) virus strain . inactivated &apos;means that the virus has been killed so that it can no longer cause disease .
what is Circovac used for ?
Circovac is used to reduce the changes in and damage to lymphoid tissues associated with PCV2 infection in piglets and to help reduce the overall deaths in piglets connected with this infection .
the vaccine is given to female pigs before and / or during pregnancy .
their piglets then become immunised when they drink the colostrum ( first milk ) from their vaccinated mothers .
Circovac is given by deep intramuscular ( into a muscle ) injection .
the timing of the injection is adjusted according to the dates of mating and farrowing ( giving birth ) .
in all cases the last dose ( and only dose , in case of re-vaccination ) is given at least two weeks before the expected date of farrowing .
how does Circovac work ?
porcine circovirus type 2 ( PCV2 ) , is known to infect , and cause a wide variety of clinical signs and syndromes in pigs , some of which may be caused by PCV2 in combination with other agents .
Circovac contains inactivated PCV2 .
when the gilt or sow is injected , the pig &apos;s immune system recognises the inactivated virus as foreign &apos;and reacts to this by producing antibodies to destroy it .
these antibodies are transferred from the mother to the piglets through the colostrum , and they help the piglets to fight the PCV2 virus if they become exposed to it after they are born .
Circovac has been studied in several trials in pregnant pigs of various breeds .
both sows and gilts ( and their piglets ) were investigated in these studies , some of which were carried out under laboratory conditions and some on farms .
the effectiveness of the product was demonstrated by measuring the amount of antibodies to PCV2 in the blood of the vaccinated sows ( or gilts ) and also in the blood of their piglets ( after they have had the colostrum ) .
the effectiveness of the product was further investigated in piglets which were directly exposed to the virus , by observing them for the development of circovirus-related symptoms .
parameters such as body weight , and the amounts of PCV2 found in some specific lymph nodes and in their blood and faeces , were taken into account .
additionally , the overall number of deaths occurring in field conditions amongst piglets born to vaccinated sows and gilts was investigated and compared to those born to unvaccinated mothers .
the length of time that Circovac is effective in the piglets has also been studied .
the main measure of the immune response was the level of antibodies against PCV2 in the piglets &apos;blood .
what benefit has Circovac shown during the studies ?
the trials showed that vaccination of the mothers with Circovac can reduce the incidence of lesions associated with circovirus infection in the lymphoid tissues of their piglets .
immunity in piglets born from vaccinated gilts or sows was shown to last for up to five weeks after they drank the colostrum .
what is the risk associated with Circovac ?
Circovac can cause a harmless temporary redness or swelling at or around the injection site , which can last for up to four days after the injection .
following injection , pigs may have an increased body temperature of 1.4 C for up to two days , and in some pigs of up to 2.5 C , but this should not last more than 24 hours after the injection .
other rarer side effects in the injected pigs are reduced activity and food intake , but these are also temporary .
for a full list of all side effects reported with Circovac , see the Package Leaflet .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
Circovac contains mineral oil .
accidental injection may cause severe pain and swelling , particularly if injected into a joint or finger , which can in rare cases lead to the loss of the finger .
if someone is accidentally injected with even a very small amount of this product , they must seek medical advice immediately and the Package Leaflet should be shown to the doctor .
if pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination , the doctor should be contacted again .
what is the time allowed before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
zero days .
why has Circovac been approved ?
they recommended that Circovac should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Circovac :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Circovac to Merial on 21 June 2007 .

what is Clomicalm ?
Clomicalm is a veterinary medicine containing the active substance clomipramine .
it is available as tablets containing 5 mg , 20 mg or 80 mg clomipramine .
what is Clomicalm used for ?
Clomicalm is used as an aid in the treatment of dogs that have behavioural problems when separated from their owners , their normal home , or other dogs .
these behavioural problems might be expressed for example by destructive behaviour or inappropriate defecation or urination in the house .
Clomicalm should not be used on its own but only in dogs that are also undergoing behavioural therapy .
Clomicalm tablets are given twice a day .
the strength and number of tablet ( s ) to use is adjusted according to the dog &apos;s weight , so that the dog is given between 2 mg and 4 mg clomipramine per kg of the dog &apos;s bodyweight per day .
how does Clomicalm work ?
the active substance in Clomicalm , clomipramine , belongs to the group of the tricyclic antidepressants .
in the body , clomipramine and its major metabolite , desmethylclomipramine prevent some neurotransmitters from being taken back up into nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord .
neurotransmitters are substances that transfer chemical signals from one nerve cell to another one .
clomipramine prevents the re-uptake of serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ) and desmethylclomipramine prevents the re-uptake of noradrenalin .
low levels of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system may be associated with depression , anxiety or aggression .
by blocking the re-uptake of serotonin and noradrenalin into nerve cells , clomipramine and its metabolite allow the levels to remain higher .
this can improve the clinical signs ( behavioural problems ) in dogs with separation-related disorders .

how has Clomicalm been studied ?
the effective dose of Clomicalm has been established in clinical studies in dogs .
the efficacy and tolerance of the medicine in animal patients was confirmed in clinical studies in various veterinary practices or clinics in the USA , and in a number of countries in Europe ( &quot; field studies &quot; ) .
in each study , treatment with clomipramine was combined with behaviour modification techniques .
the treatment results in these dogs were compared to treatment results in dogs receiving behavioural therapy alone ( no medication ) .
what benefit has Clomicalm shown during the studies ?
results of the field studies indicated that the administration of clomipramine in combination with behaviour modification techniques was effective in the relief of clinical signs of separation anxiety .
treatment with clomipramine at twice daily doses of 1 - 2 mg / kg bodyweight was effective , when compared to lower doses or to treatment with behavioural therapy alone ( placebo ) .
what is the risk associated with Clomicalm ?
Clomicalm may very rarely cause vomiting , changes in appetite , lethargy ( sleepiness ) or an elevation in liver enzymes , which are reversible when the product is discontinued .
effects on the liver have been reported , especially in dogs with existing liver problems .
vomiting may be reduced by giving the tablets with a small quantity of food .
at overdose with 20 mg / kg Clomicalm ( 5 times the maximum therapeutic dose ) , a reduction in heart rate were observed approximately 12 hours after dosing .
since Clomicalm has not been tested in pregnant or lactating bitches , its use is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation .
due to potential interactions , the administration of Clomicalm is not recommended in combination with a number of other medicines listed in the package leaflet .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
since accidental ingestion might cause serious reactions in children , the tablets are supplied in a bottle fitted with a child resistant closure .
this veterinary medicine has been developed especially for dogs and is not for use in humans .
if a person accidentally takes the medicine , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to a doctor .
why has Clomicalm been approved ?
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Clomicalm :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Clomicalm to Novartis Tiergesundheit GmbH , Germany on 1 April 1998 , which was renewed in 2003 and 2008 .
information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label / outer package .

Clomicalm may very rarely cause vomiting , changes in appetite , lethargy or an elevation in liver enzymes , which is reversible when the product is discontinued .
Hepato-biliary disease has been reported , especially with pre-existing conditions , and concurrent administrations of drugs metabolized via the hepatic system .
vomiting may be reduced by co-administration of Clomicalm with a small quantity of food .
use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
the safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established in female dogs during pregnancy and lactation .
laboratory studies in mice and rats have shown evidence of embryotoxic effects .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
recommendations on the interaction between Clomicalm and other medicaments are derived from studies in species other than dogs .
the administration of Clomicalm is not recommended in combination with , or within 2 weeks of therapy with , monoamine oxidase inhibitors .
simultaneous administration with cimetidine may lead to increased plasma levels of clomipramine .
plasma levels of certain anti- epileptic drugs , such as phenytoin and carbamazepine , may be increased by co-administration with Clomicalm .
amounts to be administered and administration route
Clomicalm should be administered orally at a dose of 1-2 mg / kg clomipramine twice daily to give a total daily dose of 2-4 mg / kg according to the following table :
dosage per administration Body weight 1.25 - 2.5 kg &gt; 2.5 - 5 kg &gt; 5 - 10 kg &gt; 10 - 20 kg &gt; 20 - 40 kg &gt; 40 - 80 kg
Clomicalm 5 mg tablet 1 tablet
Clomicalm 20 mg tablet 1 tablet
Clomicalm 80 mg tablet 1 tablet
Clomicalm may be given with or without food .
in clinical trials , a treatment time of 2-3 months with Clomicalm in combination with behavioural modification techniques was sufficient to control the symptoms of separation-related disorders .
some cases may require longer treatment .
in cases showing no improvement after 2 months , treatment with Clomicalm should be ceased .
overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) , if necessary
at overdose with 20 mg / kg Clomicalm ( 5 times the maximum therapeutic dose ) , bradycardia and arrhythmias ( atrioventricular node block and ventricular escape beats ) were observed approximately 12 hours after dosing .
overdose with 40 mg / kg ( 20 times the recommended dose ) of Clomicalm produced hunched posture , tremors , flushed abdomen and decreased activity in dogs .
250 times the recommended dose ) produced emesis , defecation , drooped eyes , trembling and quietness .
still higher doses ( 725 mg / kg ) produced , in addition , convulsions and death .
withdrawal period

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
non-selective monoamine re-uptake inhibitors , ATCvet code :
pharmacodynamic properties
clomipramine has a broad-spectrum of action in blocking the neuronal reuptake of both serotonin ( 5- HT ) and noradrenaline .
it therefore possesses the properties of a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor and a tricyclic antidepressant .
the active components in vivo are clomipramine and its major metabolite , desmethylclomipramine .
both clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine contribute to the effects of Clomicalm : clomipramine is a potent and selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor while desmethylclomipramine is a potent and selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor .
the principle mechanism of action of clomipramine is potentiation of the effects of 5-HT and noradrenaline in the brain by inhibiting their neuronal reuptake .
in addition , clomipramine has anticholinergic effects by antagonism of cholinergic muscarinic receptors .
pharmacokinetic particulars
clomipramine is well absorbed ( &gt; 80 ) from the gastrointestinal tract in dogs when administered orally but the systemic bioavailability for clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine is 22-26 due to extensive first pass metabolism by the liver .
1.5-2.5 hours ) .
the maximal plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) after oral administration of single doses of 2 mg / kg clomipramine hydrochloride were :
240 nmol / l for clomipramine and 48 nmol / l for desmethylclomipramine .
repeated administration of Clomicalm causes moderate increases in plasma concentrations , accumulation ratios after oral administration twice daily were 1.2 for clomipramine and 1.6 for desmethylclomipramine , with steady state being reached within 3 days .
at steady state , the ratio of plasma clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine concentrations is approximately 3 : 1 .
administration of Clomicalm with food causes moderately higher plasma AUC values for clomipramine ( 25 ) and desmethylclomipramine ( 8 ) as compared with administration to fasted dogs .
clomipramine is extensively bound to plasma proteins ( &gt; 97 ) in dogs .
in dogs , the volume of distribution ( VDss ) is 3.8 l / kg .
the major route of biotransformation of clomipramine is demethylation to desmethylclomipramine .
additional polar metabolites also exist .
the elimination t1 / 2 after intravenous administration of clomipramine hydrochloride in dogs was 6.4 hours for clomipramine and 3.6 hours for desmethylclomipramine .
the principle route of excretion in dogs is via the bile ( &gt; 80 ) with the remainder via the urine .

what is Convenia ?
Convenia contains cefovecin , an antibiotic which is given by injection ( under the skin ) .
it is used for dogs and cats .
there are two vials in each pack of Convenia , one vial containing a powder , and one vial containing the diluent .
the powder is dissolved in the diluent before use to make up a solution for injection .
what is Convenia used for ?
Convenia is used to treat infections caused by certain specific bacteria ( see the SPC for further details ) .
it is generally given as a single injection , and the effect of the injection lasts for up to 14 days .
depending on the infection concerned , the injection can be repeated if necessary ( up to three times ) .
it is also used in dogs to treat urinary tract infections caused by certain specific bacteria .
Convenia is used in cats to treat skin and soft tissue infections , such as wounds and abscesses .
it is also used in cats to treat urinary tract infections caused by certain specific bacteria .
how does Convenia work ?
the active substance in Convenia is cefovecin which belongs to a class of antibiotics called third generation cephalosporins .
all these cephalosporin antibiotics , including cefovecin , kill bacteria by disrupting the building of the bacterial cell walls , so the bacteria die and the infection is cured .
like other antibiotics , cefovecin is not effective against all types of bacteria .
data from laboratory studies with different bacteria showed that cefovecin was effective against the bacteria specified in the product information ( SPC and package leaflet ) .
the studies measured the rate at which the infections were cured .
what benefit has Convenia shown during the studies ?
in all studies , Convenia was as effective in curing the infection as the comparator antibiotic .
Convenia has the benefit of a long duration of activity .
what is the risk associated with Convenia ?
no side-effects have been reported with Convenia to date .
however , it should not be used in dogs or cats which have shown an allergy to any cephalosporin or penicillin-type antibiotics .
Convenia should also not be used in dogs or cats of less than 8 weeks old , or in dogs or cats with severe kidney problems ( renal dysfunction ) .
it would be dangerous to use Convenia in other animals such as guinea pigs and rabbits ( it is not licensed for use in these species ) .
as no studies have been made in breeding animals with Convenia and it has an exceptionally long duration in the body , Convenia should not be used in pregnant or lactating dogs or cats .
treated animals should not be used for breeding for 12 weeks after the last injection of Convenia .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics can cause allergies in humans , and sometimes these allergies can be very serious .
Convenia should therefore not be handled by anyone who is hypersensitive ( allergic ) to such antibiotics , or by anyone who has been advised not to work with them .
anyone allergic to penicillins or cephalosporins should also avoid contact with litter used by dogs or cats treated with Convenia .
Convenia should be handled with care and all the recommended precautions be taken to avoid exposure to the product .
if any symptoms occur after accidental exposure to Convenia , for example a skin rash , then the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately .
swelling of the face , lips or eyes , or any difficulty breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention .
Page 2 / 3 EMEA 2006 Why has Convenia been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Convenia exceed the risks for the treatment of dogs and cats with certain specified skin , soft tissue and urinary tract infections and recommended that Convenia should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

special precautions for use
special precautions for use in animals
it is prudent to reserve third generation cephalosporins for the treatment of clinical conditions , which have responded poorly , or are expected to respond poorly , to other classes of antimicrobials or first generation cephalosporins .
use of the product should be based on susceptibility testing and take into account official and local antimicrobial policies .
the safety of Convenia has not been assessed in animals suffering from severe renal dysfunction .
pyoderma is often secondary to an underlying disease .
it is , therefore , advisable to determine the underlying cause and to treat the animal accordingly .
caution should be exercised in patients that have previously shown hypersensitivity reactions to cefovecin , other cephalosporins , penicillins , or other drugs .
if an allergic reaction occurs , no further administrations of cefovecin should be administered and appropriate therapy for beta-lactam hypersensitivity should be instituted .
veterinarians should be aware that reappearance of the allergic symptoms may occur when symptomatic therapy is discontinued .
special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
penicillins and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity ( allergy ) following injection , inhalation , ingestion or skin contact .
hypersensitivity to penicillins may lead to cross sensitivity to cephalosporins and vice versa .
allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious :
do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations .
handle this product with care to avoid exposure , taking all recommended precautions .
if you develop symptoms following exposure , such as a skin rash , you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning .
swelling of the face , lips or eyes or difficulty in breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention .
if you know you are allergic to penicillins or cephalosporins , avoid contact with contaminated litter .
in the event of contact , wash skin with soap and water .
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
on very rare occasions gastrointestinal signs including emesis and / or diarrhoea have been observed .
use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
the safety of Convenia in dogs and cats has not been established during pregnancy and lactation .
treated animals should not be used for breeding for 12 weeks after the last administration .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
concurrent use of other substances that have a high degree of protein binding ( e. g. furosemide , ketoconazole , or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) ) may compete with cefovecin binding and thus may cause adverse effects .
amounts to be administered and administration route
for infections requiring prolonged treatment .
the antimicrobial activity of Convenia following a single injection lasts for up to 14 days .
skin and soft tissue infections in dogs :
a single subcutaneous injection of 8 mg / kg bodyweight ( 1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight ) .
if required , treatment may be repeated at 14 day intervals up to a further three times .
in accordance with good veterinary practice , treatment of pyoderma should be extended beyond complete resolution of clinical signs .
skin and soft tissue abscesses and wounds in cats :
a single subcutaneous injection of 8 mg / kg bodyweight ( 1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight ) .
if required , an additional dose may be administered 14 days after the first injection .
urinary tract infections in dogs and cats :
a single subcutaneous injection of 8 mg / kg bodyweight ( 1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight ) .
to reconstitute , withdraw 10 ml of the supplied diluent from its vial and add to the vial containing the lyophilised powder .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
ATCvet code :
QJ01DD91 .
pharmacodynamic properties
cefovecin is a third generation cephalosporin with a broad-spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria .
it differs from other cephalosporins in that it is highly protein bound and has a long duration of activity .
as with all cephalosporins , the action of cefovecin results from the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis ; cefovecin has bactericidal activity .
cefovecin exhibits in-vitro activity against Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella multocida which are associated with canine and feline skin infections .
anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. collected from feline abscesses were also shown to be susceptible .
in addition , cefovecin exhibits in-vitro activity against Escherichia coli which is associated with canine and feline urinary tract infections .

lowest concentration , which completely inhibits visible growth of at least 50 of isolates 2 Lowest concentration , which completely inhibits visible growth of at least 90 of isolates 3 Some of these pathogens ( e. g .
S. aureus ) exhibited natural in vitro resistance to cefovecin 4 The clinical significance of these in vitro data has not been demonstrated .
resistance to cephalosporins results from enzymatic inactivation ( -lactamase production ) , from reduced permeability by porin mutations or change in efflux , or by selection of low-affinity penicillin- binding proteins .
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmid-encoded and may be transferred if associated with transposons or plasmids .
cross resistance with other cephalosporins and other beta- lactam antibacterials can be observed .
when applying a proposed microbiological breakpoint of S 2 g / ml , no resistance to cefovecin was detected in Pasteurella multocida and Fusobacterium spp. field isolates .
when applying a proprosed microbiological breakpoint of I 4 g / ml , cefovecin resistance in S. intermedius and beta-haemolytic Streptococci isolates was less than 0.02 .
the percentage of cefovecin resistant isolates in E. coli , Prevotella oralis , Bacteroides spp. and Proteus spp. were 2.3 , 2.7 , 3.1 and 1.4 , respectively .
the percentage of cefovecin resistant isolates in coagulase negative Staphylococci spp .
S. xylosus , S. schleiferi , S. epidermidis ) is 9.5 .
Pseudomonas spp . , Enterococcus spp , and Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates are inherently resistant to cefovecin .
pharmacokinetic particulars
cefovecin has unique pharmacokinetic properties with extremely long elimination half-lives in both dogs and cats .
peak concentrations in tissue cage fluid of 31.9 g / ml were measured 2 days after administration .
fourteen days after administration , the mean cefovecin concentration in plasma was 5.6 g / ml .
plasma protein binding is high ( 96.0 to 98.7 ) and the volume of distribution is low ( 0.1 l / kg ) .
elimination half-life is long approximately 5.5 days .
cefovecin is primarily eliminated unchanged via the kidneys .
at fourteen days after administration , urine concentrations were 2.9 g / ml .
fourteen days after administration the mean cefovecin concentration in plasma was 18 g / ml .
plasma protein binding is high ( more than 99 ) and the volume of distribution is low ( 0.09 l / kg ) .
elimination half-life is long - approximately 6.9 days .
cefovecin is primarily eliminated unchanged via the kidneys .
following repeated
6 administrations at the recommended dose , elevated concentrations of cefovecin were observed in plasma .

other INFORMATION
cefovecin is a third generation cephalosporin with a broad-spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria .
it differs from other cephalosporins in that it is highly protein bound and has a long duration of activity .
as with all cephalosporins , the action of cefovecin results from the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis ; cefovecin has bactericidal activity .
cefovecin exhibits in vitro activity against Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella multocida which are associated with canine and feline skin infections .
anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. collected from feline abscesses were also shown to be susceptible .
in addition , cefovecin exhibits in-vitro activity against Escherichia coli which is associated with canine and feline urinary tract infections .
resistance to cephalosporins results from enzymatic inactivation ( -lactamase production ) or from other mechanisms .
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmid-encoded and may be transferred if associated with transposons or plasmids .
cross resistance with other cephalosporins and other beta- lactam antibacterials can be observed .
when applying a proposed microbiological breakpoint of S 2 g / ml , no resistance to cefovecin was detected in Pasteurella multocida and Fusobacterium spp. field isolates .
when applying a proposed microbiological breakpoint of I 4 g / ml , cefovecin resistance in S. intermedius and beta-haemolytic Streptococci isolates was less than 0.02 .
the percentage of cefovecin resistant isolates in E. coli , Prevotella oralis , Bacteroides spp. and Proteus spp. were 2.3 , 2.7 , 3.1 and 1.4 , respectively .
the percentage of cefovecin resistant isolates in coagulase negative Staphylococci spp .
S. xylosus , S. schleiferi , S. epidermidis ) is 9.5 .
Pseudomonas spp . , Enterococcus spp , and Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates are inherently resistant to cefovecin .
cefovecin has unique pharmacokinetic properties with extremely long elimination half-lives in both dogs and cats .
the product is available in a single pack size composed of a vial containing the freeze-dried powder , and a second vial containing the diluent .
reconstitution yields 10 ml of solution for injection .

what is Cortavance ?
Cortavance is a spray containing a solution of the active substance hydrocortisone aceponate .
what is Cortavance used for ?
Cortavance is used to treat inflamed and itchy skin conditions in dogs .
Cortavance is given once a day for 7 days .
it is sprayed on the affected area , avoiding the eyes .
the pump delivers in two sprays enough medicine to treat an area of about 100 cm2 .
if no improvement is seen after 7 days , the treatment should be re-evaluated by a veterinarian .
how does Cortavance work ?
the active substance in Cortavance , hydrocortisone aceponate , is a steroid which is a type of substance that helps to reduce inflammation .
the steroid is in a special chemical form ( a diester ) that makes it effective at low doses in skin conditions as the medicine is able to get into and remain longer in the outer layer of the skin .
how has Cortavance been studied ?
the clinical part of the dossier consisted of studies to determine the dose and of one field trial .
the field trial consisted of a multi-site study comparing treatment of dogs with itchy skin conditions with Cortavance to treatment with a different steroid-containing product .
Fifty-four dogs were treated with Cortavance and 51 with this other product .
the studies to determine the dose generally supported the chosen dose and the length of treatment .
significant improvement of the skin condition was demonstrated in several studies under controlled conditions , whereas significant reduction of itching was demonstrated in only one of these laboratory studies in which the dogs received treatment against external parasites at the same time .
results from the field trial indicated comparable efficacy between Cortavance and the comparator product .
what is the risk associated with Cortavance ?
there are no side effects reported in animals who have been treated with Cortavance .
the treatment area should not normally exceed an area corresponding to the two flanks of the animal .
before treatment , any other existing skin conditions ( such as an infection ) must be treated and Cortavance should not be used on skin ulcers .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
wash hands after use .
in case of accidental contact ( skin , eye ) , wash thoroughly with water .
in case of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the leaflet or the label to the physician .
spray preferably in a well ventilated area .
the spray is flammable and should not be used next to a naked flame or any incandescent material .
do not smoke when applying this product .
why has Cortavance been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Cortavance exceed the risks for the treatment of inflamed and itchy skin conditions and recommended that Cortavance be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Cortavance :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Cortavance to Virback S. A. on 09 / 01 / 2007 .
information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label / outer package .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
ATCvet. code :
QD07AC .
pharmacodynamic properties
the veterinary medicinal product contains the active substance hydrocortisone aceponate .
hydrocortisone aceponate ( HCA ) is a dermocorticoid with a potent intrinsic glucocorticoid activity which means a relief of both inflammation and pruritus leading to a quick improvement of skin lesions observed in case of inflammatory and pruritic dermatosis .
pharmacokinetic particulars
HCA belongs to the diesters class of the glucocorticosteroids .
the diesters are lipophilic components ensuring an enhanced penetration into the skin associated to a low plasma availability .
HCA thus accumulates in the dog &apos;s skin allowing local efficacy at low dosage .
the diesters are transformed inside the skin structures .
this transformation is responsible for the potency of the therapeutic class .
in laboratory animals , hydrocortisone aceponate is eliminated the same way as hydrocortisone ( other name for endogenous cortisol ) through urine and faeces .
topical application of diesters results in high therapeutic index : high local activity with reduced systemic secondary effects .

other INFORMATION
hydrocortisone aceponate ( HCA ) administered topically accumulates and is metabolised in skin , as suggested by radioactivity distribution studies and pharmacokinetic data .
this results in minimal amounts to reach the blood stream .
this particularity will increase the ratio between the desired local anti-inflammatory effect in the skin and the undesirable systemic effects .
HCA applications on the skin lesions provide rapid reduction of the skin redness , irritation and scratching while minimising the general effects .

EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report .
its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
this document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .

what is DEXDOMITOR ?
DEXDOMITOR contains the active substance dexmedetomidine , which belongs to a class of medicines having a psycholeptic ( sedative ) action .
it is a solution for injection .
what is DEXDOMITOR used for ?
it is used in non-invasive procedures , this means that the procedure does not involve breaking the skin or a body cavity , before inducing general anaesthesia .
the dose is chosen according to which species being treated , what it is being used for , whether it is injected into a vein or a muscle and any other medicines that are also being used .
the dose depends on the body surface area in dogs ( caluclated using body weight ) and body weight in cats .
in dogs , DEXDOMITOR is given by intravenous ( into a vein ) or intramuscular ( into a muscle ) injection .
in cats , it is given by intramuscular injection .
the duration and depth of sedation and analgesia depend on the dose that is used .
DEXDOMITOR was investigated in studies involving cats and dogs in which its effectiveness was compared with that of medetomidine .
the studies included dogs and cats of various ages and breeds , which were undergoing procedures requiring sedation or analgesia .
in dogs , both intravenous and intramuscular injections of DEXDOMITOR were studied .
DEXDOMITOR was also compared with medetomidine as a premedication in cats about to undergo general anaesthesia with ketamine and for deep sedation of dogs in combination with butorphanol .
finally , it was studied as a premedication in dogs prior to induction of general anaesthesia .
what benefit has DEXDOMITOR shown during the studies ?
the studies showed that DEXDOMITOR had an equivalent level of effectiveness as medetomidine in inducing sedation and analgesia in dogs and cats .
as for medetomidine , good &apos;or excellent &apos;analgesia was reached in about 40 to 50 of the animals , supporting its use in non-invasive mildly to moderately painful procedures .
DEXDOMITOR was at least as effective as medetomidine in inducing general anaesthesia in cats in combination with ketamine .
DEXDOMITOR also showed adequate effectiveness for deep sedation of dogs in combination with butorphanol , and as a premedication before induction of general anaesthetic , reducing the amount of anaesthetic that the dogs needed .
what is the risk associated with DEXDOMITOR ?
DEXDOMITOR causes a decrease in heart rate and body temperature .
in addition , the blood pressure will increase before returning to normal or below normal .
in some dogs and cats , there may be a decrease in breathing rate and the mucous membranes may appear pale or with a blue tinge .
vomiting may occur five to 10 minutes after injection or at the time of recovery .
muscle tremors ( shaking ) and corneal opacities ( cloudy spots in the cornea , the clear part of the eye in front of the pupil ) may occur during sedation .
other side-effects can occur when DEXDOMITOR is used with other medicines .
for a full list of all side-effects reported with DEXDOMITOR , see the Package Leaflet .
DEXDOMITOR should not be used in puppies below six months of age or in kittens below five months of age .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
if DEXDOMITOR is accidentally self-injected or taken by mouth , seek medical advice immediately and show the Package Leaflet or the label to the doctor .
however , do not drive due to the risk of sedation and changes in blood pressure .
avoid contact with the skin , eyes or mucosa ( moist body surfaces ) .
if contact does occur , rinse with large amounts of water .
the use of waterproof gloves is advisable .
pregnant women should take special care to avoid self- injection .
people who are known to be hypersensitive to dexmedetomidine or any of the other ingredients should give the medicine with caution .
Page 2 / 3 EMEA 2007 Why has DEXDOMITOR been approved ?
the Committee recommended that DEXDOMITOR be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about DEXDOMITOR :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for DEXDOMITOR on 30 August 2002 .
the marketing authorisation was renewed on 02 August 2007 .

in cats , corneal opacities may occur during sedation .
the eyes should be protected by a suitable eye lubricant .
special precautions for use
special precautions for use in animals
treated animals should be kept warm and at a constant temperature , both during the procedure and recovery .
the eyes should be protected by a suitable lubricant .
to be used with precaution in elderly animals .
nervous , aggressive or excited animals should be given the possibility to calm down before initiation of treatment .
frequent and regular monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function should be performed .
pulse oximetry may be useful but is not essential for adequate monitoring .
equipment for manual ventilation should be available in case of respiratory depression or apnoea when dexmedetomidine and ketamine are used sequentially to induce anaesthesia in cats .
it is also advisable to have oxygen readily available , should hypoxaemia be detected or suspected .
sick and debilitated dogs and cats should only be premedicated with dexmedetomidine before induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia based on a risk-benefit assessment .
use of dexmedetomidine as a premedicant in dogs significantly reduces the amount of induction drug required for induction of anaesthesia .
attention should be given during the administration of intravenous induction drugs to effect .
volatile anaesthetic requirements for maintenance anaesthesia are also reduced .
special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
in case of accidental oral intake or self-injection , seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert to the physician but DO NOT DRIVE as sedation and changes in blood pressure may occur .
avoid skin , eye or mucosal contact ; the use of impermeable gloves is advisable .
in case of skin or mucosal contact , wash the exposed skin immediately after exposure with large amounts of water and remove contaminated clothes that are in direct contact with skin .
in case of eye contact , rinse abundantly with fresh water .
if symptoms occur , seek the advice of a physician .
if pregnant women handle the product , special caution should be observed not to self-inject as uterine contractions and decreased foetal blood pressure may occur after accidental systemic exposure .
advice to doctors :
DEXDOMITOR is an 2-adrenoreceptor agonist , symptoms after absorption may involve clinical effects including dose-dependent sedation , respiratory depression , bradycardia , hypotension , a dry mouth , and hyperglycaemia .
ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported .
respiratory and haemodynamic symptoms should be treated symptomatically .
the specific 2 adrenoceptor antagonist , atipamezole , which is approved for use in animals , has been used in humans only experimentally to antagonize dexmedetomidine-induced effects .
persons with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients should administer the product with caution .
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
by virtue of its 2-adrenergic activity , dexmedetomidine causes a decrease in heart rate and body temperature .
blood pressure will increase initially and then return to normal or below normal .
in some dogs and cats , a decrease in respiratory rate may occur .
due to peripheral vasoconstriction and venous desaturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygenation , the mucous membranes may appear pale and / or with a blue tinge .
rare instances of pulmonary oedema have been reported .
vomiting may occur 5-10 minutes after injection .
some dogs and cats may also vomit at the time of recovery .
muscle tremors may occur during sedation .
corneal opacities may occur during sedation ( see also section 4.5 ) .
when dexmedetomidine and ketamine are used sequentially , with a 10 minute interval , cats may occasionally experience AV-block or extrasystole .
expected respiratory events are bradypnoea , intermittent respiratory patterns , hypoventilation , and apnoea .
in clinical trials the incidence of hypoxaemia was common , especially within the 15 first minutes into dexmedetomidine-ketamine anaesthesia .
vomiting , hypothermia and nervousness have been reported after such use .
Brady- and tachyarrhythmias have been reported .
these may include profound sinus bradycardia , 1st and 2nd degree AV block , sinus arrest or pause , as well as atrial , supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes .
when dexmedetomidine is used as a premedicant in dogs bradypnoea , tachypnoea and vomiting may occur .
Brady- and tachyarrhythmias have been reported and include profound sinus bradycardia , 1st and 2nd degree AV block and sinus arrest .
supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes , sinus pause and 3rd degree AV block may be observed in rare cases .
use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
the safety of dexmedetomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation in the target species .
therefore the use of the product during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
the use of other central nervous system depressants is expected to potentiate the effects of dexmedetomidine and therefore an appropriate dose adjustment should be made .
anticholinergics should be used with caution with dexmedetomidine .
administration of atipamezole after dexmedetomidine rapidly reverses the effects and thus shortens the recovery period .
within 15 minutes dogs are normally awake and standing .
cats :
after administration of 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine / kg bw intramuscularly concurrently with 5 mg ketamine / kg bw to cats , the maximum concentration of dexmedetomidine increased twofold but there was no effect on T max .
the mean half-life of elimination of dexmedetomidine increased to 1.6 h and the total exposure ( AUC ) increased by 50 .
4 A dose of 10 mg ketamine / kg used concurrently with 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine / kg may cause tachycardia .

amounts to be administered and administration route
the product is intended for :
- Dogs : intravenous or intramuscular use
- Cats : intramuscular use
the product is not intended for repeat injections .
DEXDOMITOR , butorphanol and / or ketamine can be mixed in the same syringe as they have been shown to be pharmaceutically compatible .
dosage : the following doses are recommended :
dogs :
the doses for dogs are based on body surface area .
the intravenous dose is 375 micrograms / square metre body surface area and the intramuscular dose is 500 micrograms / square metre body surface area when dexmedetomidine is used as the only agent for sedation and analgesia .
the dose should be adjusted to the type of surgery , length of procedure and patient temperament .
concomitant use of dexmedetomidine and butorphanol produces sedative and analgesic effects beginning no later than 15 minutes .
sedation lasts for at least 120 minutes post administration and analgesia lasts for at least 90 minutes .
spontaneous recovery occurs within 3 hours .
premedication with dexmedetomidine will significantly reduce the dosage of the induction agent required and will reduce volatile anaesthetic requirements for maintenance anaesthesia .
in a clinical study , the requirement for propofol and thiopental was reduced by 30 and 60 respectively .
all anaesthetic agents used for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia should be administered to effect .
in a clinical study , dexmedetomidine contributed to postoperative analgesia for 0.5 4 hours .
however this duration is dependent on a number of variables and further analgesia should be administered in accordance with clinical judgement .
the corresponding doses based on body weight are presented in the following tables .
use of an appropriately graduated syringe is recommended to ensure accurate dosing when administering small volumes .

the dose volume of atipamezole at the concentration of 5 mg / ml equals the dose volume of Dexdomitor that was given to the dog , regardless of route of administration of Dexdomitor .
cats :
5 times the initial dose dexmedetomidine in micrograms / kg bw .
after concurrent exposure to a triple ( 3X ) overdose of dexmedetomidine and 15 mg ketamine / kg , atipamezole can be administered at the recommended dose level for reversal of effects induced by dexmedetomidine .
at high serum concentrations of dexmedetomidine sedation is not increased although the level of analgesia does increase with further dose increases .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group : psycholeptic , ATCvet code :
pharmacodynamic properties
DEXDOMITOR contains dexmedetomidine as the active substance , which produces sedation and analgesia in dogs and cats .
the duration and depth of the sedation and analgesia are dose-dependent .
at maximal effect , the animal is relaxed , recumbent and does not respond to external stimulus .
dexmedetomidine is a potent and selective 2-adrenoceptor agonist that inhibits the release of noradrenaline from noradrenergic neurons .
sympathetic neurotransmission is prevented and the level of consciousness decreases .
reduced heart rate and temporary AV-block can be seen after administration of dexmedetomidine .
blood pressure decreases to normal or below normal levels after an initial increase .
respiration rate can occasionally decrease .
dexmedetomidine also induces a number of other 2-adrenoceptor mediated effects , which include piloerection , depression of motor and secretory functions of the gastrointestinal tract , diuresis and hyperglycaemia .
a slight decrease in temperature may be observed .
pharmacokinetic particulars
as a lipophilic compound , dexmedetomidine is well absorbed after intramuscular administration .
dexmedetomidine is also rapidly distributed in the body and penetrates the blood-brain barrier readily .
according to studies in rats , the maximum concentration in the central nervous system is several times that of the corresponding concentration in plasma .
in the circulation , dexmedetomidine is largely bound to plasma proteins ( &gt; 90 ) .
dogs :
after an intramuscular dose of 50 micrograms / kg a maximum concentration in plasma of about 12 ng / ml is reached after 0.6 hours .
the bioavailability of dexmedetomidine is 60 and the apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) is 0.9 l / kg .
major biotransformations in the dog include hydroxylation , glucuronic acid conjugation and N-methylation in the liver .
all known metabolites lack pharmacological activity .
metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine and to a lesser extent in the faeces .
dexmedetomidine has a high clearance and its elimination depends on the hepatic blood flow .
a prolonged elimination half-life is therefore expected with overdoses or when dexmedetomidine is coadministered with other substances , which affect hepatic circulation .
cats :
the maximum plasma concentration is reached about 0.24 h after intramuscular administration .
after a 40 micrograms / kg bw intramuscular dose the Cmax is 17 ng / ml .
the apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) is 2.2 l / kg and the elimination half-life ( t ) is one hour .
biotransformations in the cat occur by hydroxylation in the liver .
metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine ( 51 of the dose ) , and to a lesser extent in the faeces .
as in dogs dexmedetomidine has a high clearance in cats and its elimination depends on the hepatic blood flow .
a prolonged elimination half-life is therefore expected with overdoses or when dexmedetomidine is coadministered with other substances , which affect hepatic circulation .

not applicable
special STORAGE PRECAUTIONS
do not freeze .
after withdrawal of the first dose , the product may be stored for 28 days at 25 C.
keep out of the reach and sight of children .
special WARNING ( S )
treated animals should be kept warm and at a constant temperature , both during the procedure and recovery .
nervous , aggressive or excited animals should be given the possibility to calm down before initiation of treatment .
the safety of dexmedetomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation in the target species .
therefore the use of the product during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended .
the safety of dexmedetomidine has not been established in males intended for breeding .
to be used with precaution in elderly animals .
in cats corneal opacities may occur during sedation .
the eyes should be protected by a suitable eye lubricant .
the use of other central nervous system depressants is expected to potentiate the effects of dexmedetomidine and therefore an appropriate dose adjustment should be made .
use of dexmedetomidine as a premedicant in dogs significantly reduces the amount of induction drug required for induction of anaesthesia .
attention should be given during the administration of intravenous induction drugs to effect .
volatile anaesthetic requirements for maintenance anaesthesia are also reduced .
anticholinergics should be used with caution with dexmedetomidine .
cats :
after administration of 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine / kg bw intramuscularly concurrently with 5 mg ketamine / kg bw to cats , the maximum concentration of dexmedetomidine increased twofold but there was no effect on T max .
the mean half-life of elimination of dexmedetomidine increased to 1.6 h and the total exposure ( AUC ) increased by 50 .
a dose of 10 mg ketamine / kg used concurrently with 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine / kg may cause tachycardia .
22 Administration of atipamezole after dexmedetomidine rapidly reverses the effects and thus shortens the recovery period .
within 15 minutes dogs are normally awake and standing
for information on adverse reactions , see section Adverse reactions .
frequent and regular monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function should be performed .
pulse oximetry may be useful but is not essential for adequate monitoring .
equipment for manual ventilation should be available in case of respiratory depression or apnoea when dexmedetomidine and ketamine are used sequentially to induce anaesthesia in cats .
it is also advisable to have oxygen readily available , should hypoxaemia be detected or suspected .
sick and debilitated dogs and cats should only be premedicated with dexmedetomidine before induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia based on a risk-benefit assessment .
in cases of overdosing the following recommendations should be followed :
dogs :
in cases of overdosage , or if the effects of dexmedetomidine become potentially life- threatening , the appropriate dose of atipamezole is 10 times the initial dose of dexmedetomidine ( micrograms / kg bw or micrograms / square meter body surface area ) .
the dose volume of atipamezole at the concentration of 5 mg / ml equals the dose volume of Dexdomitor that was given to the dog , regardless of route of administration of Dexdomitor .
cats :
in cases of overdosage , or if the effects of dexmedetomidine become potentially life- threatening , the appropriate antagonist is atipamezole , administered by intramuscular injection , at the following dose :
5 times the initial dose dexmedetomidine in micrograms / kg bw .
after concurrent exposure to a triple ( 3X ) overdose of dexmedetomidine and 15 mg ketamine / kg , atipamezole can be administered at the recommended dose level for reversal of effects induced by dexmedetomidine .
at high serum concentration of dexmedetomidine sedation is not increased although the level of analgesia does increase with further dose increases .
in case of accidental oral intake or self-injection , seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert to the physician but DO NOT DRIVE as sedation and changes in blood pressure may occur .
avoid skin , eye or mucosal contact ; the use of impermeable gloves is advisable .
in case of skin or mucosal contact , wash the exposed skin immediately after exposure with large amounts of water and remove contaminated clothes that are in direct contact with skin .
in case of eye contact , rinse abundantly with fresh water .
if symptoms occur , seek the advice of a physician .
if pregnant women handle the product , special caution should be observed not to self-inject as uterine contractions and decreased foetal blood pressure may occur after accidental systemic exposure .
advice to doctors :
DEXDOMITOR is an 2-adrenoreceptor agonist , symptoms after absorption may involve clinical effects including dose-dependent sedation , respiratory depression , bradycardia , hypotension , a dry mouth , and hyperglycaemia .
ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported .
respiratory and haemodynamic symptoms should be treated symptomatically .
the specific 2 adrenoceptor antagonist , atipamezole , which is approved for use in animals , has been used in humans only experimentally to antagonize dexmedetomidine-induced effects .
persons with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients should administer the product with caution .
special PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS , IF ANY
any unused product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements .

what is Dicural ?
Dicural contains the active substance difloxacin , which is an antibiotic .
it is available as an oral solution for chickens and turkeys , as tablets for dogs ( 15 mg , 50 mg , 100 mg and 150 mg ) , and as a solution for injection for cattle and dogs .
what is Dicural used for ?
Dicural is used to treat infections caused by bacteria : in chickens and turkeys , Dicural is used to treat certain infections affecting the respiratory system ( lungs and air sacs ) .
Dicural is only used in young turkeys of up to 2 kg body weight .
it is given as tablets by mouth once a day for at least five days until the infection has been cured .
on the first day of treatment , it can be given by injection under the skin before switching to the tablets ; in cattle , Dicural is used to treat infections affecting the lungs and breathing ( shipping fever and calf pneumonia ) .
it is only used in calves and young cattle .
Dicural is given once a day for up to five days as an injection under the skin .
for full details , see the Summary of Product Characteristics ( SPC , also part of the EPAR ) .
how does Dicural work ?
the active substance in Dicural , difloxacin , belongs to a group of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones .
difloxacin works by blocking an enzyme called DNA gyrase , which is important in allowing bacteria to make copies of their DNA .
by blocking the production of DNA , difloxacin stops the bacteria that are causing an infection from growing and multiplying .
the full list of bacteria against which Dicural is active can be found in the SPC .
how has Dicural been studied ?
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. at its effects in treating pyoderma : two compared it with enrofloxacin and one compared it with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid .
in cattle , seven main studies were carried out .
all seven studies compared Dicural with enrofloxacin in calves .
what benefit has Dicural shown during the studies ?
in all species , Dicural was effective in reducing the number of infected animals or reducing the severity of infection .
Dicural was as effective as or slightly more effective than the comparator antibiotics .
what is the risk associated with Dicural ?
in chickens and turkeys , no side effects from Dicural are known .
however , since no studies have been performed in lame birds , Dicural must not be used in birds with existing leg weakness or osteoporosis ( brittle bones ) .
in dogs , side effects from Dicural are rare , but include loss of appetite , vomiting , diarrhoea and anal irritation .
these tend to disappear within one or two days and do not require additional treatment .
injection of Dicural solution for injection under the skin may result in some itching , local swelling and slight pain .
the itching tends to disappear within a few minutes and the swelling within a few days .
as for other fluoroquinolones , difloxacin should not be used in dogs that are growing quickly because it can affect the cartilage of some joints .
this includes small- and medium-sized breeds up to and including eight months of age , large breeds up to one year of age and giant breeds up to 18 months of age .
Dicural must not be used in epileptic dogs .
in cattle , injection of Dicural solution for injection under the skin may result in some temporary swelling at the site of the injection .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
people who are hypersensitive ( allergic ) to quinolones ( a group of antibiotics that includes the fluoroquinolones ) should avoid any contact with Dicural .
when handling Dicural oral solution for chickens and turkeys , use gloves and a face- protecting device to avoid irritation of the skin or eyes .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
Dicural must not be used in birds producing eggs for human consumption or within four weeks before the onset of the laying period .
after the last administration of Dicural , chickens and turkeys should not be slaughtered for 24 hours and cattle should not be slaughtered for 46 days .
why has Dicural been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Dicural are greater than the risks for the treatment and recommended that Dicural be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : general anti-infectives for systemic use ; antibacterials for systemic use , quinolone antibacterials .
ATC vet code :
QJ01MA94
the fluoroquinolones exert their antibacterial effect against both replicating and non-replicating micro-organisms .
difloxacin hydrochloride is bactericidal in activity and acts by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase .
strains of Escherichia coli , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma gallisepticum isolated from broilers and turkeys have been shown to be sensitive to difloxacin .
pharmacokinetic properties
difloxacin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration to reach steady state plasma concentrations in a few hours after initiation of medication .
difloxacin is well distributed throughout the animal body , as was demonstrated by the tissue to plasma ratios .
difloxacin concentrations equal to or greater than the MICs for the relevant pathogens are achieved in all relevant tissues and maintained for as long as medication is continued .
chickens :
96 ) .
it is well distributed in the body ( Vd = 4.7 l / kg ) and has a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 7 hours .
following continuous oral dosing with Dicural oral solution at 10 mg / kg / day for five consecutive days the mean difloxacin steady state plasma concentrations are approximately 200 ng / ml .
tissue to plasma ratios range from 0.6 ( abdominal fat ) , 2.4 ( lung ) , 4.5 ( muscle ) to 14.1 ( liver ) .
turkeys :
58 ) .
it is very well distributed in the body ( Vd = 9.9 l / kg ) and has a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 7 hours .
following continuous oral dosing of Dicural oral solution at 10 mg / kg / day for five consecutive days the mean difloxacin steady state plasma concentrations are approximately 60 ng / ml .
tissue to plasma ratios range from 2.5 ( abdominal fat ) , 3.7 ( muscle ) , 4.8 ( lung ) to 36.5 ( liver ) .
in both species difloxacin may be conjugated ( glucuronidated or sulphated ) , desmethylated into sarafloxacin or oxidised into N-oxide-difloxacin .
the main metabolites are hydrolysable conjugates of difloxacin , the other metabolites are proportionally minor ones .

Dicural Coated Tablets consist of a core tablet containing difloxacin hydrochloride and a highly palatable coating .
each strength of the product is available in packs of 10 , 20 and 100 tablets .
not all pack sizes may be marketed .
difloxacin is an aryl-fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity .
difloxacin can be bactericidal against many Gram-negative micro-organisms and a selection of Gram-positive micro- organisms .
the fluoroquinolones exert their antibacterial effects against both replicating and dormant micro- organisms .
difloxacin acts primarily through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase .

the following organisms were found to be of intermediate susceptibility :
Streptococcus canis ( beta ) Streptococcus spp .
following an oral dose ( a plain tablet ) in dogs of 5 mg / kg bodyweight , difloxacin reached its average peak plasma concentration of 1.8 g / ml in approximately 3 hours .
approximately 95 of the oral dose was absorbed .
the elimination half-life averaged 9.3 hours .
50 / 64 Long term daily oral treatment over 180 days at 5 mg / kg bodyweight did not influence difloxacin kinetics , neither by accumulation nor by increased drug metabolism .

European PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report .
this document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .
if you need more information about your animal &apos;s medical condition or treatment , contact your veterinarian .
if you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is DRAXXIN ?
DRAXXIN contains tulathromycin , which belongs to a class of medicines having an antibiotic action .
DRAXXIN is a solution for injection .
what is DRAXXIN used for ?
DRAXXIN is given as a single injection of 2.5 mg per kilogram body weight .
in cattle , it is injected under the skin , and the dose is divided in cattle weighing over 300 kg so that no more than 7.5 ml are injected at one site .
in pigs it is injected into a muscle , and the dose is divided in pigs weighing over 80 kg so that no more than 2 ml are injected at one site .
it is recommended that animals are treated in the early stages of the disease and that their response is evaluated within 48 hours .
it works by attaching to the RNA ( the molecules that instruct the cell how to make proteins ) within the bacterial cells .
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged How has DRAXXIN been studied ?
the effectiveness of DRAXXIN in treating or preventing BRD has been studied in nine main studies involving calves , carried out during an outbreak of the disease .
in the treatment studies , the cattle were infected with BRD-causing bacteria , but the cattle in the prevention studies had no symptoms of the disease .
DRAXXIN was compared with tilmicosin or florfenicol ( other antibiotics ) , and , in the prevention studies also with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
the main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms , including body temperature , breathing and recovery over a period of between two weeks and two months .
for the treatment of IBK , the effectiveness of DRAXXIN has been studied in three main studies involving calves .
in two studies , it was compared with the effectiveness of placebo , but the third also compared it to oxytetracycline ( another antibiotic ) .
the main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of cattle whose disease had been cured after three weeks .
the effectiveness of DRAXXIN in treating SRD has been studied in pigs in two main studies , where it was compared with tiamulin or florfenicol .
the main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms over 10 days .
for the prevention of SRD , the effectiveness of DRAXXIN was studied in six main studies , in which it was compared with placebo .
the main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of pigs that completed the full three or six weeks of each study without needing to be removed from the study because of SRD .
what benefit has DRAXXIN shown during the studies ?
a single 2.5-mg / kg dose of DRAXXIN was effective in treating and preventing BRD in cattle and SRD in pigs .
in all studies , DRAXXIN was at least as effective as the comparator medicines .
looking at the studies taken together , it was more effective than placebo .
in two of the three studies of IBK , DRAXXIN was more effective than placebo in curing the disease .
however , the third study found no difference between the effectiveness of DRAXXIN , oxytetracycline and placebo .
the reasons for this are not clear .
what is the risk associated with DRAXXIN ?
the subcutaneous injection of DRAXXIN to cattle often causes temporary pain and swelling at the injection site , which can last up to 30 days .
these reactions have not been seen in pigs after intramuscular injection .
other types of reaction to the injection persist for about 30 days after injection in cattle and pigs .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ?
for cattle intended for consumption as either meat or offal , 49 days must be allowed before slaughter .
for pigs intended for consumption as either meat or offal , 33 days must be allowed .
what is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption ?
DRAXXIN must not be used in cattle that are producing milk for human consumption , or in pregnant cows intended to produce milk for human consumption within two months of their expected date of giving birth .
why has DRAXXIN been approved ?
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about DRAXXIN :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for DRAXXIN to Pfizer Limited on 23 July 2003 .
information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label / outer package .

the presence of the disease in the herd should be established before preventative treatment .
DRAXXIN should only be used if pigs are expected to develop the disease within 2-3 days .
Contraindications
do not use the product simultaneously with other macrolides or lincosamides ( see section 4.8 ) .
do not use in lactating cattle producing milk for human consumption .
do not use in pregnant cows or heifers , which are intended to produce milk for human consumption , within 2 months of expected parturition .
special warnings for each target species
none
special precautions for use
special precautions for use in animals
use of the product should be based on susceptibility testing and take into account offical and local antimicrobial policies .
special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
tulathromycin is irritating to eyes .
if accidental eye exposure occurs , flush the eyes immediately with clean water .
tulathromycin may cause sensitisation by skin contact .
if accidental skin exposure occurs , wash the skin immediately with soap and water .
wash hands after use .
in case of accidental self-injection , seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician .
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
subcutaneous administration of DRAXXIN to cattle frequently causes transient pain reactions and local swellings at the injection site that can persist for up to 30 days .
no such reactions have been observed in pigs after intramuscular administration .
Pathomorphological injection site reactions are present for approximately 30 days after injection in both species .
use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
laboratory studies in rats and rabbits have not produced any evidence of teratogenic , foetotoxic or maternotoxic effects .
the safety of tulathromycin during pregnancy and lactation has not been established in cattle and pigs .
use only according to the benefit / risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
cross resistance occurs with other macrolides .
do not administer simultaneously with antimicrobials with a similar mode of action such as other macrolides or lincosamides .
amounts to be administered and administration route
cattle A single subcutaneous injection of 2.5 mg tulathromycin / kg body weight ( equivalent to 1 ml / 40 kg body weight ) .
for treatment of cattle over 300 kg body weight , divide the dose so that no more than 7.5 ml are injected at one site .
3 Pigs A single intramuscular injection of 2.5 mg tulathromycin / kg body weight ( equivalent to 1 ml / 40 kg body weight ) in the neck .
for treatment of pigs over 80 kg body weight , divide the dose so that no more than 2 ml are injected at one site .
it is recommended to treat animals in the early stages of the disease and to evaluate the response to treatment within 48 hours after injection .
if clinical signs of respiratory disease persist or increase , or if relapse occurs , treatment should be changed , using another antibiotic , and continued until clinical signs have resolved .
to ensure correct dosage body weight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing .
for multiple vial entry , an aspirating needle or multi-dose syringe is recommended to avoid excessive broaching of the stopper .
overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) , if necessary
mild myocardial degeneration has been observed in cattle receiving 5-6X the recommended dose .
in young pigs weighing approximately 10 kg given three or five times the therapeutic dose transient signs attributed to injection site discomfort were observed and included excessive vocalisation and restlessness .
lameness was also observed when the hind leg was used as the injection site .
withdrawal period ( s )

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
macrolide , ATCvet code :
QJ01F A 94
pharmacodynamic properties
tulathromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antimicrobial agent , which originates from a fermentation product .
it differs from many other macrolides in that it has a long duration of action that is , in part , due to its three amine groups ; therefore it has been given the chemical subclass designation of triamilide .
macrolides are bacteriostatic acting antibiotics and inhibit essential protein biosynthesis by virtue of their selective binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA .
they act by stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome during the translocation process .
tulathromycin possesses in vitro activity against Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis , and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoni , and Haemophilus parasuis the bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with bovine and swine respiratory disease , respectively .
increased MIC values have been found in some isolates of Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae .
4 Tulathromycin also possesses in vitro activity against Moraxella bovis , the bacterial pathogen most commonly associated with infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis ( IBK ) .
MLSB resistance may be constitutive or inducible .
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmid-encoded and may be transferable if associated with transposons or plasmids .
pharmacokinetic particulars
in cattle , the pharmacokinetic profile of tulathromycin when administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg body weight , was characterised by rapid and extensive absorption followed by high distribution and slow elimination .
the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) in plasma was approximately 0.5 g / ml ; this was achieved approximately 30 minutes post-dosing ( Tmax ) .
tulathromycin concentrations in lung homogenate were considerably higher than those in plasma .
there is strong evidence of substantial accumulation of tulathromycin in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages .
however , the in vivo concentration of tulathromycin at the infection site of the lung is not known .
peak concentrations were followed by a slow decline in systemic exposure with an apparent elimination half-life ( t1 / 2 ) of 90 hours in plasma .
plasma protein binding was low , approximately 40 .
the volume of distribution at steady-state ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration was 11 L / kg .
the bioavailability of tulathromycin after subcutaneous administration in cattle was approximately 90 .
in pigs , the pharmacokinetic profile of tulathromycin when administered as a single intramuscular dose of 2.5 mg / kg body weight , was also characterised by rapid and extensive absorption followed by high distribution and slow elimination .
the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) in plasma was approximately 0.6 g / ml ; this was achieved approximately 30 minutes post-dosing ( Tmax ) .
tulathromycin concentrations in lung homogenate were considerably higher than those in plasma .
there is strong evidence of substantial accumulation of tulathromycin in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages .
peak concentrations were followed by a slow decline in systemic exposure with an apparent elimination half-life ( t1 / 2 ) of approximately 91 hours in plasma .
plasma protein binding was low , approximately 40 .
the volume of distribution at steady-state ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration was 13.2 L / kg .
the bioavailability of tulathromycin after intramuscular administration in pigs was approximately 88 .

they act by stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome during the translocation process .
tulathromycin possesses in vitro activity against Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis , and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae , and Haemophilus parasuis the bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with bovine and swine respiratory disease , respectively .
increased MIC values have been found in some isolates of Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae .
tulathromycin also possesses in vitro activity against Moraxella bovis , the bacterial pathogen most commonly associated with infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis ( IBK ) .
MLSB resistance may be constitutive or inducible .
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmid-encoded and may be transferable if associated with transposons or plasmids .
in cattle , the pharmacokinetic profile of tulathromycin when administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg body weight , was characterised by rapid and extensive absorption followed by high distribution and slow elimination .
the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) in plasma was approximately 0.5 g / ml ; this was achieved approximately 30 minutes post-dosing ( Tmax ) .
tulathromycin concentrations in lung homogenate were considerably higher than those in plasma .
there is strong evidence of substantial accumulation of tulathromycin in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages .
however , the in vivo concentration of tulathromycin at the infection site of the lung is not known .
peak concentrations were followed by a slow decline in systemic exposure with an apparent elimination half-life ( t1 / 2 ) of 90 hours in plasma .
plasma protein binding was low , approximately 40 .
the volume of distribution at steady-state ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration was 11 L / kg .
the bioavailability of tulathromycin after subcutaneous administration in cattle was approximately 90 .
37 In pigs , the pharmacokinetic profile of tulathromycin when administered as a single intramuscular dose of 2.5 mg / kg body weight , was also characterised by rapid and extensive absorption followed by high distribution and slow elimination .
the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) in plasma was approximately 0.6 g / ml ; this was achieved approximately 30 minutes post-dosing ( Tmax ) .
tulathromycin concentrations in lung homogenate were considerably higher than those in plasma .
there is strong evidence of substantial accumulation of tulathromycin in neutrophils and alveolar macrophages .
peak concentrations were followed by a slow decline in systemic exposure with an apparent elimination half-life ( t1 / 2 ) of approximately 91 hours in plasma .
plasma protein binding was low , approximately 40 .
the volume of distribution at steady-state ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration was 13.2 L / kg .
the bioavailability of tulathromycin after intramuscular administration in pigs was approximately 88 .
not all pack sizes may be marketed .
250 ml and 500 ml vials must not be used for pigs .

what is Duvaxyn WNV ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine containing an inactivated West Nile virus ( inactivated means that the virus has been killed so that it cannot cause the disease any more ) .
what is Duvaxyn WNV used for ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine used in horses to protect against West Nile virus disease .
the vaccine reduces the number of viraemic horses ( these are horses with virus circulating in their blood stream ) The vaccine is injected intramuscularly ( into a muscle ) in the neck of the horse .
how does Duvaxyn WNV work ?
Duvaxyn WNV is a vaccine .
when it is given to horses , the animal &apos;s immune system ( their natural defence mechanism ) learns how to make antibodies ( a special type of protein ) to fight the disease .
in the future , if the horses are exposed to the West Nile virus , the immune system will be able to make those antibodies quicker and this will help them fight the disease .
how has Duvaxyn WNV been studied ?
the company carried out laboratory safety studies in both young foals ( 6 months of age ) and pregnant mares using the vaccine .
these showed the safety of the use of the vaccine in horses in general and in young ( 6 months of age or older ) and pregnant animals in particular .
they then performed a number of field trials which further confirmed the safety of Duvaxyn WNV and proved its efficacy in reducing the number of viraemic horses and thereby protecting against the disease .
what benefit has Duvaxyn WNV shown during the studies ?
the results of the safety studies indicated that the product is safe for horses . the vaccine has been shown to protect animals from the disease through a reduction of the number of viraemic horses .
what is the risk associated with Duvaxyn WNV ?
a small number of animals may show temporary local reactions , in the form of a mild , local swelling at the injection site post vaccination ( maximum 1 cm in diameter ) , that resolve by themselves within 1 to 2 days .
it is sometimes associated with pain and mild depression .
in some cases a higher temperature may occur for up to 2 days .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
in case of accidental self-injection , ingestion or spillage onto skin , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or label to the physician .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
zero days
what is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption ?
zero days
why has Duvaxyn WNV been approved ?
the benefit-risk balance can be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

what is Easotic ?
Easotic contains three active substances : hydrocortisone aceponate , miconazole nitrate and gentamicin sulphate .
it is an ear drop suspension for dogs , that is white in colour .
it is available in a 10 ml bottle .
what is Easotic used for ?
Easotic is used to treat dogs that suffer from acute or recurrent episodes of ear infections ( otitis externa ) .
it is given once a day for five days .
the dose is 1 ml , which is given directly into the ear by one activation of the pump supplied with the bottle .
the inside of the ear should be cleaned and dried before treatment and any excess hair cut away .
how does Easotic work ?
ear infections in dogs can be caused by bacteria or fungi .
they often lead to the ear ( s ) being inflamed ( red , swollen and itchy ) .
two of the active substances in Easotic , miconazole nitrate and gentamicin sulphate , work against the cause of the infection , while the third one , hydrocortisone aceponate , works on the inflammation .
hydrocortisone aceponate is a glucocorticosteroid , which is a type of substance that helps to reduce inflammation and itching .
miconazole nitrate is an antifungal that works by preventing the formation of ergosterol , which is an important part of fungal cell walls .
without ergosterol , the fungus is killed or prevented from spreading .
gentamicin sulphate is an antibiotic that belongs to the group aminoglycosides .
it acts by preventing bacteria making proteins .
this stops the bacteria growing , resulting in their death .
how has Easotic been studied ?
Easotic has been studied in dogs in both laboratory and field trials .
one large field trial was conducted in different centres throughout Europe .
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
when used at the recommended dose for five days , Easotic was as effective as the comparator medicine in improving the symptoms of ear infection ( redness , swelling , ear discharge and discomfort ) .
the medicine was well tolerated .
what is the risk associated with Easotic ?
mild reddening of the ear has been seen in around 2 of dogs .
the use of ear preparations may be associated with damage to hearing .
this is usually temporary and happens primarily in older dogs .
for a full list of all side-effects reported with Easotic , see the Package Leaflet .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
if accidental skin or eye contact occurs , wash immediately with lots of water .
if a person accidentally takes the medicine or eye irritation occurs , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to a doctor .
why has Easotic been approved ?
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
Otologicals Corticosteroids and anti-infectives in combination ATCvet code :
pharmacodynamic properties
the veterinary medicinal product is a fixed combination of three active substances ( corticosteroid , antifungal and antibiotic ) :
hydrocortisone aceponate belongs to the diesters class of the glucocorticosteroids with a potent intrinsic glucocorticoid activity which means a relief of both inflammation and pruritus leading to an improvement of clinical signs observed in otitis externa .
4 / 20 Miconazole nitrate is a synthetic imidazole derivative with a pronounced antifungal activity .
miconazole selectively inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol , which is an essential component of the membrane of yeasts and fungi including Malassezia pachydermatis .
mechanisms of resistance to azoles consist of either failure in antifungal accumulation or modification of target enzyme .
no standardised in-vitro susceptibility breakpoints have been defined for miconazole ; however , using the method by Diagnostics Pasteur , no resistant strains were found .
gentamicin sulphate is an aminoglycoside bactericidal antibiotic which acts by inhibiting protein synthesis .
its spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria , such as the following pathogenic organisms isolated from the ears of dogs :
MIC50 ( g / ml )
MIC90 ( g / ml )
range of MIC ( g / ml )
Staphylococcus spp Streptococcus spp Pseudomonas spp Escherichia coli Proteus spp
8 4 2 Between 1 and 16
MIC- minimum inhibitory concentration
since many bacterial strains may be involved in otitis externa in dogs , the mechanisms of resistance can vary .
the bacterial resistance phenotypes to gentamicin are mainly based on three mechanisms : enzymatic modification of aminoglucosides , failure of intracellular penetration of the active substance and alteration of the aminoglycoside target .
cross-resistance is mainly linked with efflux pumps which confer resistance to -lactams , quinolones and tetracyclines depending on the specificity of the pump with its substrate .
2.4 and 13 of Staphylococcus spp .
( among 122 strains ) and Proteus spp .
( among 16 strains ) respectively .
all the other bacteria species ( e. g .
Streptococcus spp , Pseudomonas spp , Escherichia coli ) were fully susceptible to gentamicin .
pharmacokinetic particulars
after application of the veterinary medicinal product into the ear canal , absorption of miconazole and gentamicin through the skin is negligible .
hydrocortisone aceponate belongs to the diesters class of glucocorticosteroids .
the diesters are lipophilic components ensuring an enhanced penetration into the skin associated with low systemic bioavailability .
the diesters are transformed inside the skin structures in C17 monoester responsible for the potency of the therapeutic class .
in laboratory animals , hydrocortisone aceponate is eliminated the same way as hydrocortisone ( other name for endogenous cortisol ) through urine and faeces .

what is Econor ?
Econor is a premix for medicated feedingstuff for pigs .
the premix is mixed into pig feed by an authorised feed mill and the resulting &quot; medicated feeding stuff &quot; is then distributed to the farmer to treat a large number of pigs .
Econor contains the active substance valnemulin at 0.5 , 1 , 10 , and 50 .
not all concentrations may be available in each country .
what is Econor used for ?
Econor is an antibiotic .
Econor improves the health and weight of the treated pigs , but may not eliminate completely the bacteria that caused lung infection .
Econor is mixed into pig food .
the dose and length of treatment depends on the condition for which it is being used .
for details , please see the Package Leaflet .
how does Econor work ?
the active substance of Econor is valnemulin , an antibiotic of the pleuromutilin group .
it works by blocking the production of proteins in the bacteria &apos;s ribosomes and inhibits the growth of bacteria .
valnemulin is active against a range of bacteria including those responsible for the intestinal and respiratory diseases listed above .
the antimicrobial effectiveness of valnemulin against bacteria causing the claimed diseases in pigs was studied in microbiological laboratories .
the efficacy of Econor in the claimed indications was investigated in challenge studies ( i. e. pigs were artifically infected with the bacteria ) or in field studies ( i. e. natural infections under farm conditions ) .
the field studies were carried out on a large number of farms in various European countries involving various breeds and crossbreeds of pigs .
Econor was used either to treat animals that were already affected by a disease or to prevent the outbreak of the disease in pigs in contact with diseased animals as well as on farms with a history of repeatedly re-occurring disease .
during the clinical trials , pigs were only fed with medicated feedingstuff containing valnemulin in different concentrations ( depending on the disease ) for up to 4 weeks ( depending on the disease ) .
efficacy of Econor was compared with the efficacy of an oral treatment with other antibiotics approved in the EU for the indication or with animals that did not receive any medication .
what benefit has Econor shown during the studies ?
25 mg / kg feed ) effectively prevented the development of the disease .
however , infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was not eliminated .
what are the side effects of Econor ?
serious adverse drug reactions following the use of Econor are mainly associated with breeds and cross breeds of Danish and / or Swedish Landrace .
extreme care should , therefore , be taken when using Econor in pigs of Scandinavian origin .
affected pigs are pyrexic ( have a high temperature ) , have a lack of appetite ; in severe cases they might become uncoordinated and remain lying down .
some pigs may also suffer oedema ( swelling caused by fluid ) or erythema ( redness ) on the hindquarters , and palpebral ( eyelid ) oedema .
if side effects occur , Econor containing food should be immediately removed ; severely affected pigs should be moved to clean , dry pens and given appropriate treatment .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
avoid direct contact with the skin , mouth and nose when mixing Econor and handling the final feed .
Econor has been developed especially for pigs and is not for use in humans .
however , if Econor is accidentially consumed by a person , seek medical advice immediately and show the product label .
people known to be allergic to valnemulin should use Econor with caution .
what is the time to allow before treated pigs can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
after the last administration of Econor ( in the feed ) , pigs should not be slaughtered for one day .
why has Econor been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) agreed that the benefits of Econor are greater than any risks to prevent or treat a range of intestinal and respiratory diseases in pigs .
the Committee recommended that Econor should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Econor :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Econor to Novartis Animal Health Austria GmbH on 14 October 1998 , which was renewed on 12 March 2004 .
information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label of the carton .

the prevention of clinical signs of porcine colonic spirochaetosis ( colitis ) when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd .
treatment and prevention of swine enzootic pneumonia .
at the recommended dosage of 10 - 12 mg / kg bodyweight lung lesions and weight loss are reduced , but infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is not eliminated .
for the treatment and prevention of swine dysentery .
the treatment of clinical signs of porcine proliferative enteropathy ( ileitis ) .
the prevention of clinical signs of porcine colonic spirochaetosis ( colitis ) when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd .
Contraindications
do not administer the product to pigs receiving ionophores .
valnemulin should not be administered to rabbits because of its toxicity in this species .
special warnings
none .
special precaution ( s ) for use
special precautions for use in animals Adverse drug reactions have occurred following the use of Econor .
their occurrence may be principally restricted to the Scandinavian countries and appears to be mainly associated with breed mixes that include Danish and / or Swedish Landrace .
extreme care should therefore be taken in the use of Econor in pigs of Scandinavian origin especially of the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds , and their crossbreeds thereof .
special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals When mixing the product and handling the final feed containing the product , direct contact with the skin and mucous membranes should be avoided .
in case of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the product label .
people with known hypersensitivity to valnemulin should administer the product with caution .
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
medication of pigs with Econor has led to the occurrence of adverse reactions in the European Union .
of the cases reported in 1999-2000 , the majority occurred in Denmark and Sweden ( one case each in Finland and Ireland ) .
in these countries , the incidence ranged from 0.03 to 1.76 of all pigs treated .
on affected farms , one third of the pigs treated were affected , with a mortality of 1 .
affected pigs are pyrexic , exhibit inappetence , and in severe cases become incoordinated , ataxic and may become recumbent .
a percentage of such pigs may also suffer oedema or erythema ( posterior in distribution ) , and palpebral oedema .
the reaction has been studied in controlled trials in susceptible animals .
mortality was less than 1 , but might be increased as a result of secondary infections .
in the case of an adverse reaction , immediate withdrawal of medication is recommended .
severely affected pigs should be removed to clean dry pens and given symptomatic treatment , including treatment for concurrent disease .
an epidemiological survey has indicated that there is likely to be an association between the susceptibility to adverse reactions and the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds , and their crossbreds thereof , especially younger pigs .
valnemulin is well-accepted in feed , but administered at concentrations above 200 mg valnemulin / kg feed may result in transient reduction in food consumption associated with unpalatability during the first few days of feeding .
use during pregnancy and lactation
whilst studies in rats and mice have not produced any evidence of teratogenic effect , the safety in pregnant and lactating sows has not been established .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
valnemulin has been shown to interact with ionophores such as monensin , salinomycin and narasin and may result in signs indistinguishable from an ionophore toxicosis .
animals should not receive products containing monensin , salinomycin or narasin , during or at least 5 days before or after treatment with valnemulin .
severe growth depression , ataxia , paralysis or death may result .
amounts to be administered and administration route
in feed use .
the uptake of medicated feed depends on the clinical condition of the animal .
in order to obtain the correct dosage the concentration of Econor has to be adjusted .
inclusion levels may also need to be increased in older pigs or pigs on restricted feed to achieve target dosage .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
ATCvet code :
QJ01XQ02
pharmacodynamic properties :
valnemulin is an antibiotic belonging to the pleuromutilin group , which acts by the inhibition of the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of the bacterial ribosome .
valnemulin has activity against a range of bacteria including those responsible for enteric and respiratory disease in pigs .
valnemulin shows high activity against Mycoplasma spp. and spirochaetes such as Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli .

valnemulin has little activity against Enterobacteriaceae , such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli .
pharmacokinetic particulars :
in pigs , after a single oral dose of radiolabelled material &gt; 90 absorption was demonstrated .
a linear relationship between concentration and dose administered was established .
after repeat dosing , slight accumulation occurred , but a steady state was achieved within 5 days .
because of a marked first pass &apos;effect , plasma concentrations are affected by the method of administration , but valnemulin is highly concentrated in tissues , particularly the lungs and liver , relative to plasma .
five days after the last of 15 doses of radiolabelled valnemulin administered to pigs , the concentration in liver was &gt; 6 times that in plasma .
73 - 95 of the daily dose of total radioactivity was recovered from the faeces .
the plasma half-life was 1.3 2.7 hours , and the majority of the total radio-activity administered was excreted within 3 days of the last administration .

valnemulin hydrochloride equivalent to valnemulin base
mg / g 10 mg / g
hypromellose and talc Colloidal anhydrous silica Isopropyl myristate Lactose
the treatment and prevention of swine dysentery .
the treatment of clinical signs of porcine proliferative enteropathy ( ileitis ) .
the prevention of clinical signs of porcine colonic spirochaetosis ( colitis ) when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd .
Contraindications
do not administer the product to pigs receiving ionophores .
valnemulin should not be administered to rabbits because of its toxicity in this species .
adverse REACTIONS
medication of pigs with Econor has led to the occurrence of adverse reactions in the European Union .
of the cases reported in 1999-2000 , the majority occurred in Denmark and Sweden ( one case each in Finland and Ireland ) .
in these countries , the incidence ranged from 0.03 to 1.76 of all pigs treated .
on affected farms , one third of the pigs treated were affected , with a mortality of 1 .
affected pigs are pyrexic , exhibit inappetence , and in severe cases become incoordinated , ataxic and may become recumbent .
a percentage of such pigs may also suffer oedema or erythema ( posterior in distribution ) , and palpebral oedema .
the reaction has been studied in controlled trials in susceptible animals .
mortality was less than 1 but might be increased as a result of secondary infections .
in the case of an adverse reaction , immediate withdrawal of medication is recommended .
severely affected pigs should be removed to clean dry pens and given symptomatic treatment , including treatment for concurrent disease .
an epidemiological survey has indicated that there is likely to be an association between the susceptibility to adverse reactions and the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds , and their crossbreds thereof , especially younger pigs .
valnemulin is well-accepted in feed , but administered at concentrations above 200 mg / kg feed may result in transient reduction in food consumption associated with unpalatability during the first few days of feeding .
if you notice any other side effects , please inform your veterinary surgeon .

name OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Econor 0.5 premix for medicated feed for pigs
valnemulin hydrochloride
statement OF THE ACTIVE AND OTHER SUBSTANCES
Econor 0.5 premix contains valnemulin in the form of valnemulin hydrochloride .
valnemulin hydrochloride equivalent to valnemulin base
mg / g 5 mg / g
hypromellose and talc Colloidal anhydrous silica Isopropyl myristate Lactose
for the treatment and prevention of swine dysentery .
the treatment of clinical signs of porcine proliferative enteropathy ( ileitis ) .
the prevention of clinical signs of porcine colonic spirochaetosis ( colitis ) when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd .
Contraindications :
do not administer the product to pigs receiving ionophores .
valnemulin should not be administered to rabbits because of its toxicity in this species .
adverse REACTIONS :
medication of pigs with Econor has led to the occurrence of adverse reactions in the European Union .
of the cases reported in 1999-2000 , the majority occurred in Denmark and Sweden ( one case each in Finland and Ireland ) .
in these countries , the incidence ranged from 0.03 to 1.76 of all pigs treated .
on affected farms , one third of the pigs treated were affected , with a mortality of 1 .
affected pigs are pyrexic , exhibit inappetence , and in severe cases become incoordinated , ataxic and may become recumbent .
a percentage of such pigs may also suffer oedema or erythema ( posterior in distribution ) , and palpebral oedema .
the reaction has been studied in controlled trials in susceptible animals .
mortality was less than 1 but might be increased as a result of secondary infections .
in the case of an adverse reaction , immediate withdrawal of medication is recommended .
severely affected pigs should be removed to clean dry pens and given symptomatic treatment , including treatment for concurrent disease .
an epidemiological survey has indicated that there is likely to be an association between the susceptibility to adverse reactions and the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds , and their crossbreds thereof , especially younger pigs .
valnemulin is well-accepted in feed , but administered at concentrations above 200 mg / kg feed may result in transient reduction in food consumption associated with unpalatability during the first few days of feeding .
if you notice any other side effects , please inform your veterinary surgeon .

special WARNING ( S )
valnemulin has been shown to interact with ionophores such as monensin , salinomycin and narasin and may result in signs indistinguishable from an ionophore toxicosis .
animals should not receive products containing monensin , salinomycin or narasin , during or at least 5 days before or after treatment with valnemulin .
severe growth depression , ataxia , paralysis or death may result .
whilst studies in rats and mice have not produced any evidence of teratogenic effect , the safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established in pigs .
when mixing the product and handling the final feed containing the product , direct contact with the skin and mucous membranes should be avoided .
in case of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the product label .
people with known hypersensitivity to valnemulin should administer the product with caution .
adverse drug reactions have occurred following the use of Econor .
their occurrence may be principally restricted to the Scandinavian countries and appears to be mainly associated with breed mixes that include Danish and / or Swedish Landrace .
extreme care should therefore be taken in the use of Econor in pigs of Scandinavian origin especially of the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds , and their crossbreeds thereof .
special PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS , IF ANY
any unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements .

European PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report .
its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
this document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .
if you need more information about your animal &apos;s medical condition or treatment , contact your veterinarian .
if you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Equilis Prequenza Te ?
Equilis Prequenza Te is a vaccine for use in horses .
the vaccine is available as a suspension for injection .
what is Equilis Prequenza Te used for ?
Equilis Prequenza Te is used to vaccinate horses from six months of age against equine influenza and tetanus .
the vaccine reduces the signs of equine influenza and the excretion ( shedding ) of the virus after infection .
equine influenza is a highly contagious disease that is very common in horses but that rarely causes death .
the vaccine also stimulates protection against tetanus to prevent mortality .
tetanus is an acute , often fatal disease caused by the neurotoxin of the bacterium Clostridium tetani .
the disease , which usually originates from contaminated wounds , is characterised by overall rigidity ( stiffness ) and convulsive spasms of the muscles .
horses belong to the most susceptible species to tetanus .
the vaccine is given as an injection into a muscle .
horses should receive a primary vaccination , consisting of two injections given four weeks apart .
to retain protection , horses need to be revaccinated .
for protection against equine influenza , the first revaccination should be five months after primary vaccination , followed by yearly revaccinations .
for protection against tetanus , the first revaccination should be no later than 17 months after primary vaccination .
afterwards , a maximum interval of two years is recommended .
vaccines work by teaching &apos;the immune system how to defend itself against diseases .
when the product is given to horses , it helps the animals &apos;immune system to react quicker when the animal is naturally exposed to the equine influenza virus and the Clostridium tetani bacterium .
this helps to protect against equine influenza and tetanus .
the vaccine also contains an adjuvant &apos;to stimulate a better immune response .
how has Equilis Prequenza Te been studied ?
the safety of Equilis Prequenza Te was studied in several studies under laboratory and field conditions in a large number of horses , from 2 months of age .
it was concluded that the product is well tolerated by horses of different ages .
Equilis Prequenza Te was also studied in pregnant mares .
no negative influence on gestation , foaling and offspring of mares was observed after vaccination at different times during pregnancy .
the effectiveness of Equilis Prequenza Te has been studied in several trials under laboratory and field conditions .
for ethical reasons no challenge ( infection ) experiment was performed against tetanus .
the main measure of effectiveness of Equilis Prequenza Te against equine influenza was the production of protective levels of antibodies against the influenza components .
the studies also compared the clinical signs and virus excretion of a group of vaccinated animals with those of a control group , ( i. e. which did not receive the vaccine or received a competitive product ) .
regarding tetanus , the main measure of effectiveness was the production of protective levels of antibodies against tetanus toxoid .
what benefit has Equilis Prequenza Te shown during the studies ?
horses developed protective levels of antibodies two weeks after primary vaccination .
the duration of protection was five months after primary vaccination and 12 months after the first revaccination for equine influenza and 17 months after primary vaccination and 24 months after the first revaccination for tetanus .
what is the risk associated with Equilis Prequenza Te ?
swelling ( max. diameter 5 cm ) may occur at the injection site , either as a diffuse hard or soft swelling .
the swelling is expected to decrease within two days .
in some cases fever may occur for one day , and up to three days in exceptional circumstances .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
in case of accidental self-injection , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the doctor .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
the withdrawal period of the product is zero days .
what is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption ?
zero days .
Page 2 / 3 EMEA 2008 Why has Equilis Prequenza Te been approved ?
the Committee recommended that Equilis Prequenza Te should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Equilis Prequenza Te :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Equilis Prequenza Te to Intervet International BV on 8 July 2005 .
information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label / outer package .

what is Equilis Prequenza ?
Equilis Prequenza is a vaccine for use in horses .
the vaccine is available as a suspension for injection .
what is Equilis Prequenza used for ?
Equilis Prequenza is used to vaccinate horses from six months of age against equine influenza .
equine influenza is a highly contagious disease that is very common in horses but that rarely causes death .
the vaccine reduces the signs of equine influenza and the excretion ( shedding ) of the virus after infection .
the vaccine is given as an injection into a muscle .
horses should receive a primary vaccination , consisting of two injections given four weeks apart .
this should be followed by a third vaccination five months later , and afterwards by yearly revaccinations .
how does Equilis Prequenza work ?
Equilis Prequenza contains fragments ( subunits ) of the influenza virus against which the vaccine is indicated for .
these fragments provoke a protective response of the immune system ( the body &apos; s natural defences ) but cannot cause the disease .
vaccines work by teaching &apos;the immune system how to defend itself against diseases .
when the product is given to horses , it helps the animals &apos;immune system to react more quickly when the animal is naturally exposed to the virus .
this helps to protect against equine influenza .
the vaccine also contains an adjuvant &apos;to stimulate a better response .
how has Equilis Prequenza been studied ?
the safety of Equilis Prequenza was studied in several studies under laboratory and field conditions in a large number of horses , from 2 months of age .
it was concluded that the product is well tolerated by horses of different ages .
Equilis Prequenza was also studied in pregnant mares .
no negative influence on gestation , foaling and offspring of mares was observed after vaccination at different times during pregnancy .
the effectiveness of Equilis Prequenza has been studied in several trials under laboratory and field conditions .
most of the studies used Equilis Prequenza Te , a vaccine that protects against the three equine influenza strains ( the same as Equilis Prequenza ) , as well as tetanus .
the main measure of effectiveness was the production of protective levels of antibodies against the influenza components .
the studies also compared the clinical signs and virus excretion of a group of vaccinated animals with those of a control group , i. e. which did not receive the vaccine .
what benefit has Equilis Prequenza shown during the studies ?
the studies showed that Equilis Prequenza is an effective vaccine against equine influenza to reduce clinical signs and virus excretion after infection , in horses from 6 months of age .
horses developed protection two weeks after primary vaccination .
the duration of protection was five months after primary vaccination and 12 months after the first revaccination .
what is the risk associated with Equilis Prequenza ?
swelling ( max. diameter 5 cm ) may occur , either as hard or soft swelling .
the swelling is expected to decrease within two days .
in some cases fever may occur for one day , and up to three days in exceptional circumstances .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
in case of accidental self-injection , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the doctor .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
the withdrawal period of the product is zero days .
what is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption ?
zero days .
why has Equilis Prequenza been approved ?
the Committee recommended that Equilis Prequenza should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

what is Equilis StrepE ?
Equilis StrepE is a vaccine which contains the active substance live deletion mutant Streptococcus equi bacteria .
no adjuvant or preservative is included .
Equilis StrepE is available as a lyophilisate ( freeze-dried pellet ) which is made up into a suspension for injection .
the vaccine is provided together with the solvent , applicator and a syringe with needle .
this is the first vaccine to be licensed for horses in the EU against strangles .
what is Equilis StrepE used for ?
Equilis StrepE is used to vaccinate horses against the respiratory disease caused by the bacteria Streptococcus equi .
the highly contagious and common disease caused by this bacterium is commonly called strangles .
in strangles , the lymph nodes in the head can become large enough to block the airway , causing the horse to have difficulty breathing .
this is a highly contagious disease and a common bacterial infection in horses .
Equilis StrepE reduces the clinical signs of disease and the occurrence of lymph node abscesses ( collections of pus ) .
how does Equilis StrepE work ?
Equilis StrepE is a vaccine .
vaccines work by teaching &apos;the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against diseases .
Equilis StrepE contains small amounts of a type of bacterium called S. equi .
when a horse is given the vaccine , the immune system recognises the bacteria as foreign &apos;and makes antibodies against them .
in the future , the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is again exposed to the bacteria .
the bacterium strain included in Equilis StrepE has had some genes removed , so that it grows less well inside the horse &apos;s body and is less likely to cause disease .
this makes it suitable for use in a vaccine .
the results of the safety trials demonstrate that Equilis StrepE is safe for horses from four months of age onwards , 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
horses from four months of age should receive a second injection after four weeks .
all horses should be revaccinated every three months to maintain immunity .
Equilis StrepE is only for use in healthy horses that are at risk of S. equi infection due to contact with horses from areas where the bacterium is known to be present .
what benefit has Equilis StrepE shown during the studies ?
the studies demonstrated that Equilis StrepE is effective in the active immunisation of horses from 4 months of age against Streptococcus equi to reduce clinical signs and occurrence of lymph node abscesses .
fewer of the horses receiving Equilis StrepE had symptoms of strangles .
they also had fewer abscesses and fewer lymph nodes affected .
what is the risk associated with Equilis StrepE ?
only healthy horses which are at risk of infection should be vaccinated .
after injection , swelling will develop at the injection site within four hours and the injection site may become warm or painful .
the reaction is greatest at two to three days after injection , but the area affected should not be larger than 3 by 8 cm .
the swelling should disappear within three weeks and should have no effect on the horse &apos;s appetite , nor cause it any discomfort .
in very rare cases an abscess and discharge may develop at the injection site , and the lymph nodes in the head may enlarge , which may be painful for a short while .
an increase in body temperature of up to 2 C may occur on the day of vaccination .
in rare cases , loss of appetite , fever and shivering may be observed .
in very rare cases depression may develop .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
in case of accidental self-injection , which can cause inflammation with severe pain and swelling , seek medical advice immediately and show the Package Leaflet or the label to the doctor , even if only a small amount has been injected .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
the withdrawal period is zero days .
why has Equilis StrepE been approved ?
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

Contraindications
none
4.4 Special warnings
shedding of the vaccine strain from the injection site can be observed for a period of four days after vaccination .
2 / 23 From literature , it is known that a very low number of horses may develop purpura haemorrhagica if they are vaccinated shortly after infection .
purpura haemorrhagica has not been observed in any of the safety studies performed during development of Equilis StrepE .
as the incidence of purpura haemorrhagica is very low , its occurrence cannot be ruled out completely .
special precautions for use
special precautions for use in animals
only healthy horses should be vaccinated .
ensure that the lyophilisate is completely reconstituted before use .
basic vaccination performed during an outbreak is not efficacious , because immunity is insufficient until basic vaccination has been completed .
special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
special care must be taken when connecting the applicator to the needle to avoid needle-stick injuries .
in case of accidental self injection , seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician .
to the user :
this product contains a live bacterial deletion mutant with a limited growth potential in mammalian tissue .
accidental self injection may result in an inflammatory reaction with severe pain and swelling .
if you are accidentally injected with this product seek prompt medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected and take the package insert with you .
to the physician :
this product contains a live auxotrophic deletion mutant Streptococcus equi vaccine strain with attenuated virulence .
however , the bacterial compounds of this product can cause an inflammatory reaction with intense and painful swelling after accidental injection .
Antiinflammatory therapy is indicated even if only a very small amount of the product in injected .
an additional antibiotic treatment should be considered for safety reasons .
the sensitivity of the vaccine strain to antibiotics is listed below ( SPC under section 4.8 )
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
after vaccination a diffusely swollen reaction , which may be warm or painful , develops at the injection site within 4 hours .
the reaction is maximal at 2-3 days post vaccination with a maximum area of 3 cm by 8 cm .
this swelling resolves completely within 3 weeks and normally has no effect on the appetite of the vaccinated animal and causes no apparent discomfort .
the vaccine organism may establish a small suppurative inflammation locally at the injection site , leading to a disruption of the overlaying lip mucosa and subsequent discharge fluid and inflammatory cells .
a slight cloudy discharge commonly occurs from the mucosal injection site at 3 or 4 days post vaccination .
slight enlargements , which may be transient painful , of the retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes may occur for a few days after vaccination .
in very rare cases an abscess may develop at the injection site or in the regional lymph nodes .
further , an increase in rectal temperature up to 2 C may occur on the day of vaccination .
in rare cases , inappetance , fever and shivering may be observed .
in very rare cases depression may develop .
3 / 23 4.7 Use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
do not use in pregnant or lactating mares .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
limited information is available on the safety and efficacy from the use of this vaccine with any other .
it is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered concurrently or simultaneously .
do not use antibiotics within one week after vaccination .
the vaccine strain is resistant to aminoglycosides , sulphonamides , flumequine , and trimetroprim-sulfa combinations .
the vaccine strain is sensitive to penicillins , tetracyclines , macrolides and lincomycin .
amounts to be administered and administration route
submucosal vaccination with 0.2 ml of reconstituted product .
allow the solvent to reach room temperature ( 15 - 25 C ) .
aseptically reconstitute the lyophilisate with 0.3 ml of the sterile solvent provided .
do NOT shake and wait 1 minute after addition of the solvent .
withdraw 0.2 ml of the reconstituted vaccine into the syringe provided ( see Figure 1 ) and connect the applicator to the needle ( see Figure 2 ) .
Restrain the animal &apos;s head , lift the upper lip and insert the needle into the inside of the upper lip until the applicator rests on the lip .
administer the whole contents of the syringe into the inside of the upper lip ( see Figure 3 ) .
figure 2
4 / 23 Vaccination scheme :
basic vaccination : horses from 4 months of age onwards receive two vaccinations of one dose with a 4 week interval .
revaccination :
revaccinate every three months to maintain immunity .
a priming response is maintained for up to six months after basic vaccination .
therefore only a single dose of vaccine is needed to restore immunity .
it is recommended that all horses stabled together are vaccinated .
overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) , if necessary
in addition to the clinical signs given under section 4.6 , vaccination with a ten times overdose may induce an abscess in one of the submandibular lymph nodes .
the abscesses drain purulent material from 2 weeks after vaccination , but heal without intervention within a month thereafter .
furthermore , an increase in rectal temperature up to 2.5 C may occur on the day of vaccination .
slight apathy may occasionally be observed one day after vaccination .
withdrawal period ( s )
zero days .
immunological PROPERTIES
ATC vet code :
QI05AE live bacterial vaccine
to stimulate immunity against Streptococcus equi .
the vaccine strain is a deletion mutant with a limited growth potential in mammalian tissue .
it is able to multiply locally at the submucosal injection site during a short period and is shed into the oro-nasal cavity during a few days , but the vaccine strain does not survive on the oro-nasal mucosa and does not disseminate systemically at the recommended dose .
in the challenge studies performed by Intervet , insufficient protection was seen in approximately one quarter of horses vaccinated with the recommended dose .

statement OF THE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND OTHER INGREDIENT ( S )
per dose of 0.2 ml vaccine :
live deletion mutant Streptococcus equi strain TW928 109.0 to 109.4 cfu1
for immunisation of horses against Streptococcus equi to reduce clinical signs and occurrence of lymph node abscesses .
the onset of immunity is established as two weeks after vaccination .
the duration of immunity is up to 3 months .
Contraindications
do not use in pregnant or lactating mares .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
after vaccination a diffusely swollen reaction , which may be warm or painful , develops at the injection site within 4 hours .
the reaction is maximal at 2-3 days post vaccination with a maximum area of 3 cm by 8 cm .
this swelling resolves completely within 3 weeks and normally has no effect on the appetite of the vaccinated animal and causes no apparent discomfort .
the vaccine organism may establish a small suppurative inflammation locally at the injection site , leading to a disruption of the overlaying lip mucosa and subsequent discharge fluid and inflammatory cells .
a slight cloudy discharge commonly occurs from the mucosal injection site at 3 or 4 days post vaccination .
20 / 23 Slight enlargements , which may be transient painful , of the retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes may occur for a few days after vaccination .
in very rare cases an abscess may develop at the injection site or in the regional lymph nodes .
further , an increase in rectal temperature up to 2 C may occur on the day of vaccination .
in rare cases , inappetance , fever and shivering may be observed .
in very rare cases depression may develop .
if you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet , please inform your veterinary surgeon .
7 TARGET SPECIES
horses
dosage FOR EACH SPECIES , ROUTES AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
submucosal vaccination of 0.2 ml of reconstituted product .
basic vaccination :
horses from 4 months of age onwards receive two vaccinations of one dose with a 4 week interval .
revaccination :
revaccinate every three months to maintain immunity .
a priming response is maintained for up to six months after basic vaccination .
therefore only a single dose of vaccine is needed to restore immunity .
it is recommended that all horses stabled together are vaccinated .
9 ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
allow the solvent to reach room temperature ( 15 - 25 C ) .
aseptically reconstitute the freeze-dried vaccine with 0.3 ml of the sterile solvent provided .
do NOT shake and wait 1 minute after addition of the solvent .
withdraw 0.2 ml of the reconstituted vaccine into the syringe provided with the vaccine ( see Figure 1 ) and connect the applicator to the needle ( see Figure 2 ) .
Restrain the animal &apos;s head , lift the upper lip and insert the needle into the inside of the upper lip until the applicator rests on the lip .
administer the whole contents of the syringe into the inside of the upper lip ( see Figure 3 ) .

other INFORMATION
for animal treatment only .
limited information is available on the safety and efficacy from the use of this vaccine with any other .
it is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered concurrently or simultaneously .
the vaccine strain is a deletion mutant with a limited growth potential in mammalian tissue .
it is able to multiply locally at the submucosal injection site during a short period and is shed into the oro-nasal cavity during a few days , but the vaccine strain does not survive on the oro-nasal mucosa and does not dissiminate systemically at the recommended dose .
shedding of the vaccine strain from the injection site can be observed for a period of four days after vaccination . from literature , it is known that a very low number of horses may develop purpura haemorrhagica if they are vaccinated shortly after infection .
purpura haemorrhagica has not been observed in any of the safety studies performed during development of Equilis StrepE .
as the incidence of purpura haemorrhagica is very low , its occurrence cannot be ruled out completely .

what is Equilis Te ?
Equilis Te is a vaccine for use in horses .
it contains the toxoid ( chemically inactivated toxin ) from the tetanus bacterium .
it is available as a suspension for injection .
what is Equilis Te used for ?
Equilis Te is used to vaccinate horses from six months of age against tetanus to prevent mortality .
tetanus is an acute , often fatal disease caused by a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani .
the disease , which usually originates from contaminated wounds , is characterised by overall rigidity ( stiffness ) and convulsive spasms of the muscles .
horses belong to the most susceptible species to tetanus .
the vaccine is given as an injection into a muscle .
horses should receive a primary vaccination , consisting of two injections given four weeks apart .
to retain protection against tetanus , horses need to be revaccinated .
the first revaccination should be no later than 17 months after primary vaccination .
afterwards , a maximum interval of two years is recommended .
how does Equilis Te work ?
Equilis Te is a vaccine containing purified tetanus toxoid .
the toxoid is a toxin processed in order to remove its toxic effect , but retain its antigenic properties .
vaccines work by teaching &apos;the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against diseases .
when the product is given to horses , it helps the animals &apos;immune system to react quicker when the animal is naturally exposed to the Clostridium tetani bacterium .
this helps to protect against tetanus .
the vaccine also contains an adjuvant &apos;to stimulate a better immune response .
how has Equilis Te been studied ?
the safety of Equilis Te was studied in several studies under laboratory and field conditions in a large number of horses , from 2 months of age .
all studies were performed with Equilis Prequenza Te ( comment : double ; mentioned in next paragraph ) .
it was concluded that the product is well tolerated by horses of different age .
studies in pregnant mares were also performed .
no negative influence on gestation , foaling and offspring of mares was observed after vaccination at different times during pregnancy .
the effectiveness of Equilis Te has been studied in several trials under laboratory and field conditions .
most of the studies were performed with Equilis Prequenza Te , a vaccine that protects against equine influenza as well as against tetanus .
for ethical reasons no challenge ( infection ) experiment was performed against tetanus .
the main measure of effectiveness was the production of protective levels of antibodies against tetanus toxoid after vaccination .
what benefit has Equilis Te shown during the studies ?
the studies showed that Equilis Te is an effective vaccine against tetanus to prevent mortality in horses from 6 months of age .
horses developed protection two weeks after primary vaccination .
the duration of protection against tetanus was 17 months after primary vaccination and 24 months after the first revaccination .
what is the risk associated with Equilis Te ?
swelling ( max. diameter 5 cm ) may occur at the injection site , either as diffuse hard or soft swelling .
the swelling is expected to decrease within two days .
in some cases fever may occur for one day , and up to three days in exceptional circumstances .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
in case of accidental self-injection , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the doctor .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
the withdrawal period of the product is zero days .
what is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption ?
zero days .
why has Equilis Te been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Equilis Te exceeded the risks for the immunisation of horses from six months of age against tetanus to prevent mortality .
the Committee recommended that Equilis Te should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
Page 2 / 3 EMEA 2008 Other information about Equilis Te :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Equilis Te to Intervet International BV on 8 July 2005 .

what is EQUIOXX ?
EQUIOXX contains the active substance firocoxib in an oral paste for horses ( 8.2 mg / g ) .
this medicine is the same as Previcox oral paste for horses , which is already authorised in the European Union .
the company that makes Previcox has agreed that its scientific data can be used for EQUIOXX .
what is EQUIOXX used for ?
EQUIOXX is used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis ( swelling and pain in the joints ) and reduce the lameness that is associated with the disease in horses .
the dose is 0.1 mg firocoxib per kg bodyweight , given once a day .
EQUIOXX is presented as a paste with a special syringe that allows the right amount of medicine to be drawn and given directly into the horse &apos;s mouth .
the duration of treatment will depend on the horse &apos;s response , but should not exceed 14 days .
how does EQUIOXX work ?
the active substance in EQUIOXX , firocoxib , is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) that belongs to the group of medicines called cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors &apos; ( or Coxibs ) .
it blocks the COX-2 enzyme , resulting in a reduction in the production of prostaglandins , substances that are involved in the inflammation process .
by reducing the production of prostaglandins , EQUIOXX helps reduce the symptoms of inflammation , including pain .
how has EQUIOXX been studied ?
EQUIOXX has been studied in laboratory animals , as well as in horses that were treated in various veterinary practices / clinics across Europe ( &quot; clinical studies &quot; ) .
the studies looked at the 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
what benefit has EQUIOXX shown during the studies ?
what are the side-effects of EQUIOXX ?
these reactions are generally temporary and reversible when the treatment is stopped .
EQUIOXX must not be administered with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs .
care should also be taken when used with medicines which have an effect on the kidney such as diuretics .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
wash hands after use of the product .
avoid contact with eyes and skin .
women of child-bearing age should avoid contact with , or wear disposable gloves , when administering the product .
in case of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
what is the time to allow before a horse can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
after the last day of treatment with EQUIOXX , horses should not be slaughtered for 26 days .
the use of EQUIOXX is not permitted in mares producing milk for human consumption .
why has EQUIOXX been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of EQUIOXX exceed the risks for the treatment of relief of pain and inflammation in horses and recommended that EQUIOXX be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

in case of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
avoid contact with eyes and skin .
if it occurs , rinse affected area immediately with water .
wash hands after use of the product .
women of child-bearing age should avoid contact with , or wear disposable gloves , when administering the product .
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
lesions ( erosion / ulceration ) of the oral mucosa and of the skin around the mouth may occasionally be observed in treated animals .
typically , these lesions are mild and resolve without treatment , but oral lesions may be associated with salivation and labial and tongue oedema .
use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
no data is available in horses .
however , studies with laboratory animals have shown embryo- foetotoxicity , malformations , delayed parturition and decreased pup survival .
therefore , do not use in breeding , pregnant or lactating animals .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
other NSAIDs , diuretic and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and lead to toxic effects .
do not use concomitantly with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs .
pre-treatment with other anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and a treatment-free period with such products should therefore be observed .
the treatment- free period should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously .
concomitant treatment with molecules displaying action on renal flow ( e. g. diuretics ) should be subject to clinical monitoring .
concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity .
amounts to be administered and administration route
oral use .
administer 0.1 mg firocoxib per kg bodyweight , once daily .
duration of treatment will be dependent on the response observed , but should not exceed 14 days .
to administer EQUIOXX at the dose of 0.1 mg firocoxib / kg , set the syringe plunger to the appropriate dose division for the horse &apos;s weight .
each full dose division on the syringe plunger delivers sufficient firocoxib to treat 100 kg body weight .
the contents of one syringe will treat horses weighing up to 600 kg .
to ensure correct dosage , bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid overdosing .
to deliver firocoxib at the appropriate dosage , unlock the knurled ring on the syringe plunger by rotating it turn and slide it along the plunger shaft to the appropriate dose division for the horse &apos;s weight .
rotate the plunger ring turn to lock it in place and ensure it is locked .
make sure the horse &apos;s mouth contains no feed .
remove the cover from the tip of the syringe .
insert the syringe tip into the horse &apos;s mouth at the interdental space and deposit the paste on the base of the tongue .
3 / 17 4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) , if necessary
lesions ( erosion / ulceration ) of the oral mucosa and of the skin around the mouth may occasionally be observed in treated animals when administered the recommended treatment dose .
typically , these lesions are mild and resolve without treatment , but oral lesions may be associated with salivation and labial and tongue oedema .
the incidence of oral / skin lesions increases with increasing dose .
at high dosages and prolonged treatment ( 3 times the recommended dose for 42 consecutive days and 2.5 times the recommended dose for 92 consecutive days administered once daily ) mild to moderate renal lesions were observed .
if clinical signs occur , treatment should be discontinued and symptomatic treatment initiated .
withdrawal period
meat and offal :
26 days Do not use in mares producing milk for human consumption .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products , non-steroids , ATC vet code :
pharmacodynamic properties
firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) belonging to the Coxib group , which acts by selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) -mediated prostaglandin synthesis .
cyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins .
COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain , inflammation , and fever .
coxibs therefore display analgesic , anti-inflammatory , and antipyretic properties .
the concentration of firocoxib required to inhibit 50 of the COX-2 enzyme ( i. e . , the IC50 ) is 0.0369 to 0.12 M , whereas the IC50 for COX-1 is 20.14 to 33.1 M.
pharmacokinetic particulars
following oral administration in horses at the recommended dose of 0.1 mg per kg of bodyweight , firocoxib is rapidly absorbed , and the time to maximal concentration ( Tmax ) is 3.9 ( 4.4 ) hours .
the elimination half-life ( t ) after a single dose is 29.6 ( 7.5 ) hours and 50.6 hours after 14 days of dosing .
firocoxib is approximately 97 bound to plasma proteins .
following multiple oral administrations , the steady state is reached by approximately the eighth daily dose .
firocoxib is metabolised predominantly by dealkylation and glucuronidation in the liver .
elimination is principally in the excreta ( primarily the urine ) , with some biliary excretion also observed .

what is Eurican Herpes 205 ?
Eurican Herpes 205 is a powder and solvent that is made into an emulsion for injection .
Eurican Herpes 205 contains the active substance canine herpes virus ( F205 strain ) antigens in a dose of 0.3 to 1.75 g .
what is Eurican Herpes 205 used for ?
Eurican Herpes 205 is used to immunise pregnant bitches to prevent mortality , clinical signs and lesions in puppies caused by canine herpes virus infections acquired in the first few days of life .
Eurican Herpes 205 is given as two 1 ml subcutaneous ( under the skin ) doses .
the second injection is given 1 to 2 weeks before the expected date of whelping .
the bitch should be revaccinated in the same way during each pregnancy .
how does Eurican Herpes 205 work ?
Eurican Herpes 205 contains small amounts of canine herpes virus antigens .
when injected , this small exposure helps the dog &apos;s immune system to synthesize antibodies against the canine herpes virus and to neutralize it .
once vaccinated , bitches will , through colostrum , give those antibodies to puppies .
when exposed to canine herpes virus later in life , the puppies will either not become infected or have a much less serious infection .
Eurican Herpes 205 is intended to protect the puppies from this infection during the first few days of life .
how has the effectiveness of Eurican Herpes 205 been studied ?
Eurican Herpes 205 has been studied in three laboratory studies and two field trials .
the first laboratory study tested the dose needed to provide protection .
the second study was carried out to show the protection of puppies from vaccinated bitches from canine herpe svirus .
the last one has demonstrating that induction of antibodies is equivalent when bitches are vaccinated the day of heat or 7-10 days after mating .
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
Eurican Herpes 205 showed good protection from canine herpes virus .
in the study to show the protection of puppies ( from vaccinated bitches ) from canine herpes virus , over 80 of the pups from the vaccinated bitches survived ..
what are the side effects of Eurican Herpes 205 ?
the injection of Eurican Herpes 205 may cause temporary oedema ( fluid under the skin ) at the injection site in up to 10 of animals .
this side effect usually disappears within one week .
rarely , hypersensitivity ( allergic ) reactions may occur , which require treatment .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
Eurican Herpes 205 contains mineral oil .
accidental injection may cause severe pain and swelling , particularly if injected into a joint or finger rarely causing the loss of a finger .
the Package Leaflet should be taken to the doctor .
if pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination , the doctor should be contacted again .
why has Eurican Herpes 205 been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) agreed that the benefits of Eurican Herpes 205 are greater than any risks to immunise healthy bitches against canine herpes virus .
they recommended that Eurican Herpes 205 should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit- risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Eurican Herpes 205 :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Eurican Herpes 205 to Merial on 26 March 2001 .
information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the labelling .

an additional dose is recommended for kittens living in high-risk areas for Feline Leukaemia Virus whose first dose was administered before 12 weeks of age .
Fevaxyn Pentofel is then given once every year .
how does Fevaxyn Pentofel work ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel contains small amounts of four inactivated viruses and one inactivated bacterium .
when injected , this small exposure helps the cat &apos;s immune system to recognise and attack the viruses and bacterium .
when exposed to any of these viruses and bacterium later in life , the cat will either not become infected or will have a much less serious infection .
how has the effectiveness of Fevaxyn Pentofel been studied ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel has been studied against Feline Leukaemia , against respiratory diseases caused by Feline Rhinotracheitis virus , Feline Calicivirus and Feline Chlamydia psittaci , as well as against disease caused by Feline Panleukopenia virus .
in addition , studies in cats of various breeds were carried out to observe any side effects of Fevaxyn Pentofel after the first and second vaccinations .
Fevaxyn Pentofel has been shown to be effective against Feline Leukaemia , against respiratory diseases caused by Feline Rhinotracheitis virus , Feline Calicivirus and Feline Chlamydia psittaci , as well as against disease caused by Feline Panleukopenia virus .
in the trial to observe side effects , there were no side effects in 94.2 of cats for the first vaccination and no side effects observed for 99 of cats for the second vaccination .
what are the side effects of Fevaxyn Pentofel ?
some vaccinated cats may develop reactions to the vaccine , which include temporary fever , vomiting , anorexia ( not eating ) , and / or depression , which usually disappear within 24 hours .
occasionally there is swelling , pain , pruritus ( itching ) or hair loss at the injection site .
in very rare cases there is an anaphylactic reaction ( severe allergy ) with oedema ( fluid under the skin ) , pruritus , respiratory and cardiac distress , severe gastrointestinal signs or shock during the first hours after vaccination .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
Fevaxyn Pentofel contains mineral oil .
accidental injection may cause severe pain and swelling , particularly if injected into a joint or finger rarely causing the loss of a finger .
if someone is accidentally injected with this product , they must seek immediate medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected .
the Package Leaflet should be taken to the doctor .
if pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination , the doctor should be contacted again .
why has Fevaxyn Pentofel been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal , Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) agreed that the benefits of Fevaxyn Pentofel are greater than any risks to immunise healthy cats of 9 weeks or older against feline viruses .
they recommended that Fevaxyn Pentofel should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

4.4 Special warnings
vaccination does not affect the course of FeLV infection in cats already infected with FeLV at the time of vaccination , implying that such cats will excrete FeLV irrespective of vaccination ; consequently , these animals will constitute a hazard to susceptible cats in their environment .
it is therefore recommended that cats with a significant risk of having been exposed to FeLV be tested for FeLV antigen prior to vaccination .
test negative animals can be vaccinated , while test-positive cats should be isolated from other cats and retested within 1-2 months .
2 / 19 Cats positive at the second testing should be considered as being permanently infected with FeLV and should be handled accordingly .
cats negative at second testing can be vaccinated since , in all likelihood , they have overcome the FeLV infection .
special precautions for use
special precautions for use in animals
in case of anaphylactoid reaction , adrenaline should be administered intramuscularly .
vaccination of FeLV positive cats is of no benefit .

European PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report .
its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
this document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .
if you need more information about your animal &apos;s medical condition or treatment , contact your veterinarian .
if you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Flexicam ?
Flexicam contains meloxicam which belongs to a class of medicines having anti- inflammatory action .
Flexicam is presented as a pale green oral suspension ( 1.5mg / ml ) for dogs ( to be given mixed with food ) and a yellow solution for injection ( 5mg / ml ) for dogs and cats .
Flexicam is a generic : this means that Flexicam is similar to a reference veterinary medicine &apos; already authorised in the EU ( Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension ) .
studies have been carried out to prove that Flexicam is bioequivalent &apos; to the reference veterinary medicine : this means that Flexicam is equivalent to Metacam 1.5 mg / ml suspension in the way it is absorbed and used by the body .
what is Flexicam used for ?
alleviation of inflammation and pain in both acute and chronic musculo-skeletal disorders and reduction of post-operative pain and inflammation following orthopaedic and soft tissue surgery .
reduction of post-operative pain after ovariohysterectomy and minor soft tissue surgery .
how does Flexicam work ?
Flexicam contains meloxicam , which belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
meloxicam acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis .
as the prostaglandins are substances that trigger inflammation , pain , exudation and fever , meloxicam reduces those responses .
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
what benefit has Flexicam shown during the studies ?
what is the risk associated with Flexicam ?
occasional side effects of Flexicam are those seen with NSAIDs , such as loss of appetite , vomiting , diarrhoea , blood appearing in the stools and apathy ( lack of vitality ) .
these side effects occur usually within the first week of treatment and are generally temporary .
they disappear once treatment has stopped .
in very rare cases , they may be serious or fatal .
Flexicam should not be administered to pregnant or lactating animals as the safety of the product has not been established in these cases .
an oral follow-up therapy using meloxicam or other NSAIDs should not be used in cats , as no safe dosage for repeated oral administration has been established .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
people with known hypersensitivity ( allergic ) to meloxicam should avoid contact with the product .
accidental self-injection may give rise to pain .
if the product is swallowed by a person , the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately .
in case of accidental self-injection , medical advice should be sought immediately showing the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
why has Flexicam been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) considered that , in accordance with European Union requirements , Flexicam has been shown to be bioequivalent to Metacam 1.5 mg / ml oral suspension .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Flexicam :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Flexicam to Omnipharm Ltd. on 10 April 2006 and an extension to Flexicam 5mg / ml solution for injection on 9 December 2008 .
information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label / outer package .

none .
4.5 Special precautions for use
special precautions for use
if side effects occur , treatment should be discontinued and the advice of the veterinarian should be sought .
avoid use in any dehydrated , hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal , as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity .
2 / 34 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product product to animals
people with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product .
in case of accidental ingestion , seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician .
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
typical adverse drug reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite , vomiting , diarrhoea , faecal occult blood and apathy have occasionally been reported .
these side effects occur generally within the first treatment week and are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal .
use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
the safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation ( see 4.3 ) .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
other NSAIDs , diuretics , anticoagulants , aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects .
Flexicam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids .
pre- treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment .
the treatment-free period , however , should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously .
amounts to be administered and administration route
to be administered mixed with food .
initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam / kg body weight on the first day .
treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration ( 24-hour intervals ) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam / kg body weight .
particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing .
the suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser ( for very small breeds ) or the Flexicam measuring syringe provided in the package .
the dispenser provides 0.05 mg meloxicam per drop ( ie. a dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam / kg body weight corresponds to 2 drops / kg body weight ) .
the syringe fits onto the bottle and has a kg-body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose ( ie .
0.1 mg meloxicam / kg body weight ) .
thus for the first day , twice the maintenance volume will be required .
shake well before use .
a clinical response is normally seen within 3- 4 days .
treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent .
avoid introduction of contamination during use .
overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) ( if necessary )
in the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
non-steroidal , anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID )
ATCvet Code :
pharmacodynamic properties
meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis , thereby exerting anti-inflammatory , analgesic , anti-exudative and antipyretic effects .
it reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue .
to a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation .
in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that meloxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) to a greater extent than cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
absorption Meloxicam is completely absorbed following oral administration and maximal plasma concentrations are obtained after approximately 7.5 hours .
when the product is used according to the recommended dosage regime , steady state concentrations of meloxicam in plasma are reached on the second day of treatment .
distribution There is a linear relationship between the dose of meloxicam administered and plasma concentration observed in the therapeutic dose range .
approximately 97 of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins .
the volume of distribution is 0.31 / kg .
metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma and is also a major biliary excretion product whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound .
meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol , an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites .
all major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive .
elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours .
approximately 75 of the administered dose of meloxicam is eliminated via faeces and the remainder via urine .

pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment .
the treatment-free period , however , should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products , non-steroids ( oxicams ) ATCvet code :
pharmacodynamic properties
meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) of the oxicam class , which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis , thereby exerting anti-inflammatory , analgesic , anti-exudative and antipyretic effects .
it reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue .
to a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation .
in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that meloxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) to a greater extent than cyclooxygenase-1 ( COX-1 ) .
pharmacokinetic particulars
absorption Following subcutaneous administration , meloxicam is completely bioavailable and maximal mean plasma concentrations of 0.73 g / ml in dogs and 1.1 g / ml in cats were reached approximately 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours post administration , respectively .
distribution There is a linear relationship between the dose administered and plasma concentration observed in the therapeutic dose range in dogs .
more than 97 of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins .
the volume of distribution is 0.3 l / kg in dogs and 0.09 l / kg in cats .
metabolism In dogs , meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma and is also a major biliary excretion product whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound .
meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol , an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites .
all major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive .
elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours in dogs and 15 hours in cats .
approximately 75 of the administered dose is eliminated via faeces and the remainder via urine .

target SPECIES
dogs
dosage FOR EACH SPECIES , ROUTE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam / kg body weight on the first day .
treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration ( at 24- hour intervals ) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam / kg body weight .
shake well before use .
to be administered mixed with food .
the suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser ( for very small breeds ) or the Flexicam measuring syringe provided in the package ( see below ) .
the dispenser provides 0.05mg meloxicam per drop ( i. e. a dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam / kg body weight corresponds to 2 drops / kg body weight ) .
the syringe fits onto the bottle and has a kg- body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose ( i. e .
0.1 mg meloxicam / kg body weight ) .
thus for the first day , twice the maintenance volume will be required .
dosing procedure using the measuring syringe :
a clinical response is normally seen within 3- 4 days .
treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent .
avoid introduction of contamination during use .

what is Gonazon ?
Gonazon contains the active substance azagly-nafarelin .
Gonazon is authorised as a concentrate that is made into a solution for injection for salmonid fish and also as an implant for dogs .
Gonazon implant is rectangular in shape , off white , with dimensions of 14x3x1 mm .
what is Gonazon used for ?
following anaesthesia , the fish are injected intraperitoneally ( into the area that contains the abdominal organs ) along the central line , 1 / 2 to 1 fin length in front of the pelvic fin base .
the recommended dose is 32 g / kg bodyweight .
in bitches , Gonazon is also indicated for the prevention of gonadal function via long term blockade of gonadotrophin synthesis .
Gonazon is injected subcutaneously , in the region of the umbilicus .
the implant may be administered to bitches from the age of four months ( blocking reproductive function for an average of 12 months ) to 6 years ( blocking reproductive function for an average of 11 months ) .
how does Gonazon work ?
Gonazon contains azagly-nafarelin , which is an analogue of a natural hormone called gonadotrophin- releasing hormone ( GnRH ) .
GnRH controls reproduction in fish by increasing the secretion of the gonadotrophins controlling egg production .
in dogs , administration of higher doses of GnRH agonists over a period of time desensitises the pituitary gland with the result that release of gonadotrophins is suppressed , leading to a suppression of reproductive function .
how has Gonazon been studied ?
in fish , Gonazon has been studied in three studies of rainbow trout , two studies of Altlantic salmon , and one study of Arctic charr .
the main measure of effectiveness was the speed of response to treatment and the advance in time and synchronisation of the spawning period .
bitches treated with Gonazon generally failed to display heat during the study compared to bitches who did not receive the treatment .
good efficacy has been demonstrated for the prevention of heat and ovulation in adult bitches aged up to 7 years during the one or two years of treatment .
data on the return to oestrus , ovulatory oestrus and subsequent fertility once treatment has ended ( i. e. once the implant had been removed ) were limited , especially for repeated treatment .
what benefit has Gonazon shown during the studies ?
in fish , the results of the trials showed that Gonazon was effective to induce and synchronise ovulation .
in most cases , an effect was induced within 6-11 days of treatment , and ovulation was generally advanced by 2-3 weeks .
in bitches , it has been demonstrated that the insertion of a Gonazon implant will prevent heat and ovulation in adult bitches aged up to 7 years during the one or two years of treatment .
what is the risk associated with Gonazon ?
in fish , the injection of Gonazon may be associated with a reduction in fecundity ( ability to breed ) , egg quality and survival to the eyed-egg stage .
in some cases this can be caused by use of Gonazon too early in the spawning season .
in bitches , Gonazon works by inhibition of the production of sex steroids and may be associated with rare cases of vaginitis in prepubertal females .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
operators should wear gloves when mixing the concentrate solution or handling the implant and avoid self injection .
in case of accidental contact with either the skin or the eyes , rinse thoroughly with water .
the package leaflet or the label should be shown to the doctor .
operators should wash their hands after use of the product .
why has Gonazon been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) agreed that the benefits of Gonazon are greater than any risks for the induction and synchronisation of ovulation for the production of eyed-eggs and fry .
Gonazon implants are effective in prevention of gonadal function via long term blockade of gonadotrophin synthesis .
the CVMP recommended that Gonazon should be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Gonazon :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Gonazon to Intervet International BV on 22 July 2003 .
Gonazon implants were authorised by an extension application , granted by the European Commission in January 2007 .

indications for use , specifying the target species
induction and synchronisation of ovulation for the production of eyed-eggs and fry .
Contraindications
do not use Gonazon before approximately 10 of the specific broodstock population has ovulated naturally .
the product should not be used in fish maintained in water temperatures that would normally inhibit ovulation as this can result in a decrease in egg quality .
special warnings for each target species
reductions in fecundity , egg quality and survival to the eyed-egg stage have been observed in fish treated with azagly-nafarelin .
in some cases this can be related to the use of the compound too early in the spawning season .
2 / 37 It is recommended to strip fish after injection at intervals of approximately 50-100 degree days .
for Arctic charr , injections should be given only if the water temperature is &lt; 8 C.
the long term effects of azagly-nafarelin on treated broodstock fish have not been studied .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmaceutical group : gonadotrophin-releasing hormone .
ATC vet code :
pharmacodynamic properties
azagly-nafarelin is a synthetic analogue of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) .
GnRH is synthesised by neurones in the hypothalamus in all vertebrate species .
it controls reproduction in fish by modulating the secretion of the pituitary gonadotrophins , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , also known in fish endocrinology as GtH-II and GtH-I , respectively .
GnRH analogues are peptides .
azagly-nafarelin , like other GnRH analogues , mimics the action of GnRH , through modulation of the secretion of LH and FSH in mammals and fish .
pharmacokinetic particulars
azagly-nafarelin is rapidly absorbed after intraperitoneal treatment in rainbow trout .
the distribution and metabolism of azagly-nafarelin have not been studied in the target species .
azagly-nafarelin is rapidly eliminated from plasma after IP treatment in rainbow trout .
the elimination half-life ( T1 / 2 ) and Mean Residence Time of azagly-nafarelin in trout after IP treatment of 32 g / kg BW are 4.9 h and 6.8 h , respectively .

name OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Gonazon 18.5 mg implant for dogs
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
active substance :
18.5 mg per implant
for a full list of excipients see section 6.1
pharmaceutical FORM
implant
Gonazon implant is a solid , off white , 14x3x1 mm implant .
clinical PARTICULARS
target species
dogs ( bitches )
indications for use , specifying the target species
prevention of gonadal function in bitches via long term blockade of gonadotrophin synthesis .
Contraindications
do not use in bitches ( prepubertal and adult ) intended for breeding ( see section 4.7 ) .
special warnings
based on field trial data , it is evident that the implant may not be retained in a proportion ( 1.2 ) of treated bitches .
if the implant cannot be palpated in the month following administration , the owner is encouraged to seek veterinary advice as efficacy cannot be ensured in these cases .
at the end of a one year treatment , it may not be possible to locate and remove the implant in approximately 10 of cases .
to minimise this problem , caution needs to be exercised to ensure that the implant is administered by subcutaneous injection , particularly in dogs with pronounced depots of subcutaneous fat .
inability to locate and remove Gonazon will not have serious effects on the general health of the dog .
however , the timing of return to heat cannot be predicted .
a large proportion ( 68 ) of the first heat after a single treatment in adult bitches were non-ovulatory .
in addition following a repeat treatment , the timing of a return to heat cannot be accurately predicted .
no data are available on repeat treatments in prepubertal bitches .
accidental ingestion of the implant by the dog will not affect its health , since the oral bio-availability of GnRH agonists is very low .
7 / 37 4.5 Special precautions for use
special precautions for use in animals
treatment in proestrus will not suppress that particular heat ( proestrus and oestrus ) .
in the absence of clinical information , do not treat bitches less than 3 kg bodyweight and bitches of giant breeds over 45 kg bodyweight .
in adult bitches , heat is commonly induced in the first month following the first administration of the implant .
the frequency of induced heat is lower when the first treatment is administered in metoestrus ( 32 ) than in anoestrus ( 84 ) .
therefore , the first treatment should preferably be administered in metoestrus .
the incidence of induced heat following administration of a repeat treatment to bitches that have not shown signs of oestrus following a previous administration of the product is low ( estimated to be 8 ) .
the risk of inducing a fertile heat is low in metoestrus ( 5 ) .
administration of Gonazon at other stages of the cycle may induce heat that may be fertile .
if a bitch becomes pregnant following induced heat , embryonic resorption or abortion may occur .
therefore , if heat is observed , contact with male dogs should be prevented until all signs of heat ( vulvar swelling , bleeding and attractiveness to male dogs ) cease .
induced heat is not observed if treatment is started before puberty .
in addition , the frequency of induced heat is lower in younger bitches than in older bitches .
a proportion of bitches that show induced heat may subsequently develop pseudopregnancy .
however , based on field trial data , the incidence of pseudopregnancy in treated bitches is not greater than in control ( untreated ) bitches .
the product when administered at the recommended treatment dose is ineffective in bitches aged 7 years or older .
special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
personal protective equipment , consisting of gloves , should be worn when handling the veterinary medicinal product .
avoid accidental self-injection .
in case of accidental self-administration of the implant , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
adverse reactions ( frequency and seriousness )
owing to their pharmacological activity ( inhibition of the production of sex steroids ) , administration of GnRH agonists to bitches might be associated with vaginitis .
use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
the use is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation .
laboratory studies have shown that administration of the product during early pregnancy in the bitch is unlikely to affect that pregnancy ( that is , pregnancy will be carried to full term with the birth of viable pups ) .
the product is contraindicated in bitches intended for breeding ( adult and prepubertal ) as laboratory studies in which dogs received 3 simultaneous implants for a period of 12 months revealed a reduction in the numbers of live pups at whelping and weaning compared to an untreated control group .
8 / 37 4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
azagly-nafarelin is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidases and not by cytochrome P-450 enzymes .
therefore , drug interactions would not be expected to occur .
in a limited laboratory study , co-administration of Gonazon and short-acting progestagens has been shown to be well tolerated .
however , interactions with other medicinal products have not been investigated .
amounts to be administered and administration route
the recommended dose is one implant per bitch .
the implant may be administered to bitches from the age of four months .
in adult bitches , the first treatment should be administered preferably in metoestrus .
the duration of prevention of gonadal function is obtained as detailed in the table below :
age at which treatment is started
4 months 3 years old
3
average duration of blockade
months
months
( standard deviation )
( 24 days )
( 93 days )
based on field data , the occurrence of oestrus after a single treatment was prevented for 12 months or more in 75 of treated adult bitches and 90 of treated prepubertal bitches .
however , it should be noted that within the first month after treatment a proportion of treated bitches also experienced an induced heat ( see section 4.5 ) .
the product , when administered at the recommended treatment dose , is ineffective in bitches aged seven years or older .
in bitches where gonadal function has been successsfully prevented for a period of 12 months , then a second treatment may be administered at that time for continued prevention of oestrus .
there are no data available for animals treated on more than two occasions .
Gonazon should be injected subcutaneously , in the ventral anterior abdominal wall , in the region of the umbilicus , using aseptic technique .
the method of administration is as follows :
position the bitch on her back .
prepare a small area ( e. g .
4 cm ) of the ventral anterior abdominal / umbilical region for an aseptic procedure .
open the foil pouch using the pre-cut incision to remove the sterile injection device .
remove the needle cap .
unlike liquid injections , there is no need to remove air bubbles as attempts to do so may displace the implant from the needle .
using aseptic technique , raise a small piece of skin in the region of the dogs umbilicus .
with the bevel of the needle facing upwards , insert the needle at a 30 degree angle to the tented skin in a single motion , subcutaneously .
take care to avoid penetrating the abdominal wall musculature or fat tissue .
with your free hand , use the thumb grip to hold the injection device in position , and depress the plunger as far as it can go .
this retracts the needle and withdraws it , leaving the implant beneath the skin .
withdraw the needle from the skin .
ensure that the administration site is clean and dry .
instruct the owner to keep the administration site clean and dry for 24 hours .
record the date of treatment in the clinical records of the animals .
9 / 37 REMOVAL :
chemical restraint ( sedation and / or general anaesthesia ) may be required for implant removal .
position the dog as described for administration of the implant .
locate the implant by gentle digital palpation of the administration site .
prepare the site for an aseptic technique .
after adequate ( local ) anaesthesia is present , apply gentle digital pressure to the far end of the implant .
make a stab incision , approximately 5 mm long , along the elevated near end of the implant .
push the implant gently towards the stab incision .
if necessary , dissect away any fibrous tissue to free the implant .
grasp it with forceps and remove .
instruct the owner to keep the administration site clean and dry for 24 hours .
overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) , if necessary
risk of overdose is negligible owing to the type of formulation and administration ( single dose implant for subcutaneous administration ) .
simultaneous administration of five implants during a one- year period was well tolerated .
withdrawal period
not applicable .
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
gonadotrophin-releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) ATCvet code :
azagly-nafarelin , a GnRH agonist , has biphasic effects on the pituitary gland when administered continuously .
initially , it stimulates pituitary function and secretion of the gonadotrophins LH ( luteinising hormone ) and FSH ( follicle stimulating hormone ) .
this brief phase may result in induced heat within one to four weeks following the first administration of the implant ( see section 4.5 ) .
long- term administration results in pituitary desensitisation to the effects of GnRH resulting in a suppression of LH and FSH secretion by the pituitary .
as a consequence , there is no follicular follicle growth ( hence no oestrus is observed ) and no ovulation .
the transition between the stimulatory and inhibitory effects is completed within approximately one month .
pharmacokinetic particulars
following subcutaneous administration of a single implant to dogs ( approximate weight of 10 kg ) , maximum serum concentrations ( 0.13 g / ml ) of azagly-nafarelin are reached around 3.5 hours .
these maximal azagly-nafarelin concentrations are followed by a slow decline in circulating azagly-nafarelin concentrations lasting up to 12 months .
the apparent volume of distribution of azagly-nafarelin following intravenous bolus administration , at a dose equivalent to the content of one implant , is 0.12 l / kg .
the clearance of azagly-nafarelin following intravenous administration of the same dose is 0.46 l / h and the elimination half-life is 1.8 hours .

dog ( bitches ) .
dosage FOR EACH SPECIES , ROUTE ( S ) AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
for subcutaneous administration .
in the absence of clinical information , do not treat bitches less than 3 kg bodyweight and bitches of giant breeds over 45 kg bodyweight .
the recommended dose is one implant per bitch .
the implant may be administered to bitches from the age of four months .
in adult bitches , the first treatment should be administered preferably in metoestrus .

in bitches where gonadal function has been successsfully prevented for a period of 12 months , then a second treatment may be administered at that time for continued prevention of oestrus .
there are no data available for animals treated on more than two occasions .
advice ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Gonazon should be injected subcutaneously , in the ventral anterior abdominal wall , in the region of the umbilicus , using aseptic technique .
position the bitch on her back .
prepare a small area ( e. g .
4 cm ) of the ventral anterior abdominal / umbilical region for an aseptic procedure ( Fig .
open the foil pouch using the pre-cut incision to remove the sterile injection device .
remove the needle cap .
unlike liquid injections , there is no need to remove air bubbles as attempts to do so may displace the implant from the needle .
using aseptic technique , raise a small piece of skin in the region of the dog &apos;s umbilicus .
with the bevel of the needle facing upwards , insert the needle at a 30 degree angle to the tented skin in a single motion ( Fig .
take care to avoid penetrating the abdominal wall musculature or fat tissue .
with your free hand , use the thumb grip to hold the injection device in position , and depress the plunger as far as it can go .
this retracts the needle and withdraws it , leaving the implant beneath the skin ( Fig .
withdraw the needle from the skin .
ensure that the administration site is clean and dry .
instruct the owner to keep the administration site clean and dry for 24 hours .
record the date of treatment in the clinical records of the animal .
removal :
chemical restraint ( sedation and / or general anaesthesia ) may be required for implant removal .
position the dog as described for administration of the implant .
locate the implant by gentle digital palpation of the administration site .
prepare the site for an aseptic technique .
after adequate ( local ) anaesthesia is present , apply gentle digital pressure to the far end of the implant .
make a stab incision , approximately 5 mm long , along the elevated near end of the implant .
push the implant gently towards the stab incision .
if necessary , dissect away any fibrous tissue to free the implant .
grasp it with forceps and remove .
instruct the owner to keep the administration site clean and dry for 24 hours .
treatment in proestrus will not suppress that particular heat ( proestrus and oestrus ) .
in adult bitches , heat is commonly induced in the first month following the first administration of the implant .
the frequency of induced heat is lower when the first treatment is administered in metoestrus ( 32 ) than in anoestrus ( 84 ) .
therefore , the first treatment should preferably be administered in metoestrus .
the incidence of induced heat following administration of a repeat treatment to bitches that have not shown signs of oestrus following a previous administration of the product is low ( estimated to be 8 ) .
the risk of inducing a fertile heat is low in metoestrus ( 5 ) .
administration of Gonazon at other stages of the cycle may induce heat that may be fertile .
if a bitch becomes pregnant following induced heat , embryonic resorption or abortion may occur .
therefore , if heat is observed , contact with male dogs should be prevented until all signs of heat ( vulvar swelling , bleeding and attractiveness to male dogs ) cease .
induced heat is not observed if treatment is started before puberty .
in addition , the frequency of induced heat is lower in younger bitches than in older bitches .
a proportion of bitches that show induced heat may subsequently develop pseudopregnancy .
however , based on field trial data , the incidence of pseudopregnancy in treated bitches is not greater than in control ( untreated ) bitches .
the product when administered at the recommended treatment dose is ineffective in bitches aged 7 years or older .
withdrawal PERIOD
not applicable .
special STORAGE PRECAUTIONS
keep out of the reach and sight of children .
do not use after the expiry date which is stated on the label EXP &apos;Do not store above 25 C.
special WARNING ( S )
the implant may not be retained in a proportion ( 1.2 ) of treated bitches .
if the implant cannot be palpated in the month following administration , the owner is encouraged to seek veterinary advice as efficacy cannot be ensured in these cases .
at the end of a one year treatment , it may not be possible to locate and remove the implant in approximately 10 of cases .
to minimise this problem , caution needs to be exercised to ensure that the implant is administered by subcutaneous injection , particularly in dogs with pronounced depots of subcutaneous fat .
inability to locate and remove Gonazon will not have serious effects on the general health of the dog .
however , the timing of return to heat cannot be predicted .
a large proportion ( 68 ) of the first heat after a single treatment in adult bitches were non-ovulatory .
in addition following a repeat treatment , the timing of a return to heat cannot be accurately predicted .
no data are available on repeat treatments in prepubertal bitches .
accidental ingestion of the implant by the dog will not affect its health , since the oral bio-availability of GnRH agonists is very low .
the use is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation .
laboratory studies have shown that administration of the product during early pregnancy in the bitch is unlikely to affect that pregnancy ( that is , pregnancy will be carried to full term with the birth of viable pups ) .
personal protective equipment , consisting of gloves , should be worn when handling the veterinary medicinal product .
avoid accidental self-injection .
in the event of accidental self-administration of the implant , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
special PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS , IF ANY
ask your veterinary surgeon how to dispose of medicines no longer required .
these measures should help to protect the environment .

what is Halocur used for ?
Halocur is used in newborn calves to prevent or reduce diarrhoea due to an organism called Cryptosporidium parvum .
this is a parasite belonging to the protozoa &apos;family that invades the digestive system causing diarrhoea .
in all cases , Halocur is given to the calf by mouth after a feed , not on an empty stomach , once a day for seven consecutive days .
how does Halocur work ?
the active substance in Halocur , halofuginone lactate , prevents the growth of Cryptosporidium parvum .
this contributes to the spread of the disease to other animals .
clinical signs of Cryptosporidium parvum infection are seen mainly as diarrhoea .
the exact way halofuginone works is unknown .
how has Halocur been studied ?
a number of field trials were performed involving calves from different farms .
in one trial , calves were included from 40 farms .
treatment with the recommended dose of Halocur orally during 7 consecutive days , in calves aged from 4 to 10 days was shown to reduce diarrhoea compared to placebo .
another trial of calves aged from 24 to 48 hours demonstrated that Halocur can prevent diarrhoea due to Cryptosporidium parvum compared with placebo .
what benefit has Halocur shown during the studies ?
Halocur treatment was shown to reduce the level of excretion of Cryptosporidium parvum by the calves and to reduce diarrhoea .
it was also shown to prevent diarrhoea following 11 days of treatment .
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
early treatment in the first 24 to 48 hours after birth was shown to be most beneficial .
what is the risk associated with Halocur ?
symptoms of toxicity may occur if Halocur is administered at twice the recommended dose .
such symptoms can include diarrhoea , visible blood in the faeces , a decline in milk consumption , dehydration , apathy ( lack of responsiveness ) , weakness and collapse .
Halocur should not be administered to calves in cases where diarrhoea has been established for more than 24 hours , or to weak animals .
Halocur should be given after feeding .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
people who handle Halocur repeatedly may develop skin allergies .
users should avoid skin and eye contact with the product and if such contact happens , they should wash the exposed area thoroughly with clean water .
if eye irritation persists , medical advice should be sought .
protective gloves should be worn while handling the product and hands should be washed after use .
Halocur should not enter watercourses as this may be dangerous for fish and other aquatic organisms .
any unused product or waste materials should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements .
what is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption ( withdrawal period ) ?
days .
what is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption ?
not applicable since the product is only to be used in newborn calves .
why has Halocur been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Halocur outweigh the risks in the prevention and reduction of diarrhoea due to Cryptosporidium parvum in newborn calves .
they recommended that Halocur be given a marketing authorisation .
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .

EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report .
its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use ( CVMP ) on the basis of the documentation provided , led to the recommendations on the conditions of use .
this document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian .

if you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Ibaflin ?
Ibaflin contains ibafloxacin , which belongs to a class of medicines having an antibiotic action .
Ibaflin is available as tablets ( 30 , 150 , 300 and 900 mg ) and as oral gels ( 3 and 7.5 ) .
what is Ibaflin used for ?
it is also used in dogs to treat acute ( short-lived ) , uncomplicated infections of the urinary tract caused by Staphylococci , Proteus species , Enterobacter species , E. coli and Klebsiella species .
Ibaflin is given by mouth .
dogs are treated using the tablets , except for skin infection , where in addition to the tablets either strengths of the oral gel may be used .
cats are treated using the 3 oral gel .
the dose and duration of treatment depend on the nature and severity of the infection , the weight and species of the animal being treated , and the animal &apos;s response to treatment .
the standard dose is 15 mg per kilogram body weight once a day for the length of time determined by your veterinarian .
for more information , see the Package Leaflet .
how does Ibaflin work ?
ibafloxacin , is an antibiotic belonging to the class fluoroquinolones .
it works by blocking an enzyme called DNA gyrase , which is important in allowing bacteria to make copies of their DNA .
this enzyme is only found in bacterial cells , and does not have a similar function in animal cells .
by blocking DNA gyrase , ibafloxacin prevents the bacteria from making DNA and stops them making proteins and growing , resulting in their death .
a strain which is resistant to one type of fluoroquinolone will also be resistant to other members of the class of fluoroquinolones .
the use of ibafloxacin may result in an increase in the prevalence of resistant strains in the target species although this risk is likely to be less of a concern due to the treatment of individual animals with this product .
Ibaflin tablets have been studied in dogs , looking at their effectiveness in treating skin , urinary tract and respiratory tract infections .
the oral gel has been studied in cats looking at skin , respiratory tract and urinary tract infections .
in these studies , the effects of Ibaflin were compared with those of other antibiotics ( marbofloxacin , enrofloxacin or amoxicillin / clavulanic acid ) .
the indication for treatment of urinary infections in cats was not accepted .
Ibaflin oral gel is indicated in dogs for the treatment of skin infections ( pyoderma superficial and deep , wounds , abscesses ) .
comparable efficacy of the gel formulation to the tablet formulation was shown for dogs in a clinical trial .
what benefit has Ibaflin shown during the studies ?
Ibaflin tablets were at least as effective as the comparator antibiotics in treating skin , urinary tract and upper tract respiratory infections in dogs .
the tablets and oral gel were of comparable effectiveness in treating skin infections in dogs .
the oral gel was also at least as effective as the comparator antibiotic ( amoxicillin / clavulanic acid ) in treating skin and upper respiratory tract infections in cats .
however , the results were insufficient to support the use of Ibaflin in the treatment of urinary tract infections in cats .
what are the side-effects associated with Ibaflin ?
diarrhoea , soft faeces , vomiting , dullness ( lack of responsiveness ) and anorexia ( loss of appetite ) occur with low frequency in dogs and cats given Ibaflin .
salivation can also occur with the oral gel .
these effects are mild and temporary .
what are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal ?
people who are hypersensitive ( allergic ) to quinolones should avoid any contact with Ibaflin .
medical advice should be sought if the tablets are swallowed accidentally , particularly by a child .
why has Ibaflin been approved ?
the benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR .
other information about Ibaflin :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Ibaflin to Intervet International B. V. on 13 June 2000 .
the marketing authorisation was renewed on 13 June 2005 .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antibacterial quinolone ATCvet code :
QJ 01 MA Ibaflin contains ibafloxacin as active ingredient .
ibafloxacin is a synthetic antimicrobial substance of the fluoroquinolone class .
ibafloxacin is a broad spectrum , bactericidal antibiotic .
its action results from inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase .
the most abundant metabolite is 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin , which is also microbiologically active .
ibafloxacin and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin act synergystically .
for ibafloxacin ( parent compound ) , MIC values ranging from 0.032 0.5 g / ml are observed for canine isolates of E. coli , Staphylococcus spp . , Proteus mirabilis , strains of Pasteurella spp. and Salmonella spp .
a strain which is resistant to a fluoroquinolone will also be resistant to other members of the class of fluoroquinolones .
pharmacokinetic properties
after oral administration in dogs , ibafloxacin is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma levels of microbiologically active compounds obtained at 1-2 hours after administration .
terminal plasma half- life is approximately 4-5 hours .
Ibaflin can be administered at any time of the day without consequences for efficacy .
however , it is preferred to administer the tablet at feeding time to ensure maximal bioavailability .
the main excretory route is via urine and faeces .
after multiple oral administration , steady state is reached after the first or second dosing and no accumulation or induction of biotransformation enzymes occurs .
clinical PARTICULARS
target species
dogs
2 / 42 5.2 Indications for use
Ibaflin is indicated for the treatment of the following conditions in dogs :
dermal infections ( pyoderma superficial and deep , wounds , abscesses ) caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococci , E. coli , and Proteus mirabilis .
acute , uncomplicated urinary tract infections , caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococci , Proteus spp . , Enterobacter spp . , E. coli and Klebsiella spp .
respiratory tract infections ( upper tract ) caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococci , E. coli , and Klebsiella spp .
contra-indications
do not use in dogs during the period of growth as articular cartilage may be affected .
this period depends on the breed .
for the majority of breeds the use of ibafloxacin is contra-indicated in dogs less than 8 months of age and in giant breeds less than 18 months .
do not use in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) in dogs with a history of seizures .
undesirable effects
diarrhoea , soft faeces , vomiting , dullness and anorexia have been observed with low frequency .
these effects were mild and transient .
special precautions for use
heavy reliance on a single class of antibiotic may result in the induction of resistance in a bacterial population .
it is prudent to reserve the fluoroquinolones for the treatment of clinical conditions which have responded poorly , or are expected to respond poorly , to other classes of antibiotic .
Ibaflin should only be used based on susceptibility testing .
do not use in dogs with known quinolone hypersensitivity .
pyoderma is mostly secondary to an underlying disease .
it is advisable to determine the underlying cause and to treat the animal accordingly .
use during pregnancy and lactation
can be used during pregnancy .
the safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during lactation .
the influence on fertility in male breeding dogs has not been studied .
interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
fluoroquinolones should not be used in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) in dogs with a history of seizures .
antacids can interfere with gastro-intestinal absorption of quinolones .
antagonism may be observed with nitrofurantoin .
5.8 Posology and method of administration
oral use , 15 mg ibafloxacin / kg once daily .
the duration of treatment depends on the nature and severity of the infection and on the response .
in most cases , a 10-day treatment course will be sufficient .
if necessary and depending on the clinical response , treatment can be continued until the response is considered to be adequate .
the treatment should be reconsidered if at 5 days no improvement in the clinical condition is observed .
if in cases of deep pyoderma , sufficient improvement is not seen after a treatment course of 21 days , it is recommended that the treatment is reconsidered .
3 / 42 To ensure a correct dosage body weight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing .
the following dosage scheme is advised :
