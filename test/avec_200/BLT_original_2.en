hypersensitivity to the active substance , peanut or soya or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
45 In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgment .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported very rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
however , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported .
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
47 Olanzapine tablets contain lactose monohydrate .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
the film-coating contains soya lecithin .
patients who are allergic to peanut or soya must not take these tablets .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
the metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female nonsmokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
48 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
50 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56- &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l- &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HCL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
51 The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the propotion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
gastrointestinal disorders Common :
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
52 Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05AH03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor undesirable-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
53 showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined .
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
54 The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity :
effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
58 During treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5-20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
a lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
a lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
the starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
the starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance , peanut or soya or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
59 In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgment .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported very rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
however , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported .
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
61 Olanzapine tablets contain lactose monohydrate .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
the film-coating contains soya lecithin .
patients who are allergic to peanut or soya must not take these tablets .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
the metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female nonsmokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
64 2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56- &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l- &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HCL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
65 Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the propotion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
gastrointestinal disorders Common :
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose
there is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05AH03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor undesirable-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined .
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity :
effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity
69 Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5-20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
a lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
a lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
the starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
the starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance , peanut or soya or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
73 In the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgment .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported very rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
however , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported .
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
75 Olanzapine tablets contain lactose monohydrate .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
the film-coating contains soya lecithin .
patients who are allergic to peanut or soya must not take these tablets .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
the metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female nonsmokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
76 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
78 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56- &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l- &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HCL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
79 The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the propotion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
gastrointestinal disorders Common :
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05AH03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor undesirable-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
81 showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined .
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
82 The plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity :
effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

what is Olanzapine Neopharma ?
olanzapine Neopharma is a medicine containing the active substance olanzapine .
it is available as tablets ( white and round :
2.5 , 5 , 7.5 and 10 mg ; blue and oval :
olanzapine Neopharma is a generic medicine .
this means that Olanzapine Neopharma is similar to a reference medicine &apos;already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) called Zyprexa .
for more information on generic medicines , see the question-and-answer document here .
what is Olanzapine Neopharma used for ?
olanzapine Neopharma is used to treat adults with schizophrenia .
olanzapine Neopharma is also effective in maintaining improvement in patients who have responded to an initial course of treatment .
olanzapine Neopharma is also used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes ( extremely high mood ) in adults .
it can also be used to prevent the recurrence of these episodes ( when symptoms come back ) in adults with bipolar disorder ( a mental illness causing alternating periods of high mood and depression ) who have responded to an initial course of treatment .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Olanzapine Neopharma used ?
the dose is adjusted depending on how well the patient responds to and tolerates the treatment .
the usual dose range is between 5 and 20 mg per day .
patients over 65 years of age and patients who have problems with their liver or kidneys may need a lower starting dose of 5 mg per day .
its exact mechanism of action is unknown , but it attaches to several 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain .
this disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by neurotransmitters , chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other .
it is thought that olanzapine &apos;s beneficial effect is due to it blocking receptors for the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine ( also called serotonin ) and dopamine .
since these neurotransmitters are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , olanzapine helps to normalise the activity of the brain , reducing the symptoms of these diseases .
how has Olanzapine Neopharma been studied ?
because Olanzapine Neopharma is a generic medicine , studies have been limited to tests to demonstrate that it is bioequivalent to the reference medicine ( i. e. that the two medicines produce the same levels of the active substance in the body ) .
what are the benefit and risk of Olanzapine Neopharma ?
because Olanzapine Neopharma is a generic medicine and is bioequivalent to the reference medicine , its benefit and risk are taken as being the same as those of the reference medicine .
why has Olanzapine Neopharma been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that , in accordance with EU requirements , Olanzapine Neopharma has been shown to have comparable quality and to be bioequivalent to Zyprexa .
therefore , the CHMP &apos;s view was that , as for Zyprexa , the benefit outweighs the identified risk .
the Committee recommended that Olanzapine Neopharma be given marketing authorisation .
other information about Olanzapine Neopharma :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Olanzapine Neopharma to Neopharma Limited on 14 November 2007 .
the full EPAR for Olanzapine Neopharma can be found here .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
2 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
0.4 , respectively ) .
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
however , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
9 Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
10 9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
11 dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and
prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
16 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
0.4 , respectively ) .
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
however , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
23 Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
24 9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
25 dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and
prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
30 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
0.4 , respectively ) .
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
however , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
37 Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
0.4 , respectively ) .
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
51 Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :

sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
59 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
risk factors that may predispose this patient population to increased mortality include age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary conditions ( e. g . , pneumonia , with or without aspiration ) , or concomitant use of benzodiazepines .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
0.4 , respectively ) .
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
however , as clinical experience with olanzapine in patients with concomitant illness is limited , caution is advised when prescribing for patients with prostatic hypertrophy , or paralytic ileus and related conditions .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
66 Long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) , approximately half of adolescent
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta-agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

European PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
it explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
if you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
if you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Olanzapine Teva ?
olanzapine Teva is a medicine containing the active substance olanzapine .
it is available as tablets ( white and round :
2.5 , 5 , 7.5 and 10 mg ; blue and oval :
mg ; pink and oval :
mg ) and as round orodispersible &apos;tablets ( yellow :
5 and 10 mg ; orange :
mg ; green :
orodispersible tablets are tablets that dissolve in the mouth .
olanzapine Teva is a generic medicine .
this means that Olanzapine Teva is similar to reference medicines &apos;already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) called Zyprexa and Zyprexa Velotab .
for more information on generic medicines , see the question-and-answer document here .
what is Olanzapine Teva used for ?
olanzapine Teva is used to treat adults with schizophrenia .
olanzapine Teva is also effective in maintaining improvement in patients who have responded to an initial course of treatment .
olanzapine Teva is also used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes ( extremely high mood ) in adults .
it can also be used to prevent the recurrence of these episodes ( when symptoms come back ) in adults with bipolar disorder ( a mental illness causing alternating periods of high mood and depression ) who have responded to an initial course of treatment .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Olanzapine Teva used ?
the dose is adjusted depending on how well the patient responds to and tolerates the treatment .
the usual dose range is between 5 and 20 mg per day .
the orodispersible tablets , which can be used as an alternative to the tablets , are taken by being placed on the tongue , where they disintegrate quickly in the saliva , or by mixing them in water before swallowing .
patients over 65 years of age and patients who have problems with their liver or kidneys may need a lower starting dose of 5 mg per day .
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged .
how does Olanzapine Teva work ?
the active substance in Olanzapine Teva , olanzapine , is an antipsychotic medicine .
it is known as an atypical &apos;antipsychotic because it is different from the older antipsychotic medicines that have been available since the 1950s .
its exact mechanism of action is unknown , but it attaches to several receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain .
this disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by neurotransmitters , chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other .
it is thought that olanzapine &apos;s beneficial effect is due to it blocking receptors for the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine ( also called serotonin ) and dopamine .
since these neurotransmitters are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , olanzapine helps to normalise the activity of the brain , reducing the symptoms of these diseases .
how has Olanzapine Teva been studied ?
because Olanzapine Teva is a generic medicine , studies have been limited to tests to demonstrate that it is bioequivalent to the reference medicines ( i. e. that the medicines produce the same levels of the active substance in the body ) .
what are the benefit and risk of Olanzapine Teva ?
because Olanzapine Teva is a generic medicine and is bioequivalent to the reference medicines , its benefit and risk are taken as being the same as those of the reference medicines .
why has Olanzapine Teva been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that , in accordance with EU requirements , Olanzapine Teva has been shown to have comparable quality and to be bioequivalent to Zyprexa and Zyprexa Velotab .
therefore , the CHMP &apos;s view was that , as for Zyprexa and Zyprexa Velotab , the benefit outweighs the identified risk .
the Committee recommended that Olanzapine Teva be given marketing authorisation .
other information about Olanzapine Teva :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Olanzapine Teva to Teva Pharma BV on 12 December 2007 .
the full EPAR for Olanzapine Teva can be found here .
the full EPARs for the reference medicines can also be found on the EMEA &apos;s website .

qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
each film-coated tablet contains 2.5 mg olanzapine .
each film-coated tablet contains 71.3 mg lactose .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
film-coated tablet
a white , biconvex , round tablet , with the inscription &quot; OL 2.5 &quot; on one side .
clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
2 Children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17 - &lt; 6.2 mmol ) to high ( 6.2 mmol ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :

sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
11 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
in a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-
12 CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
13 Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
16 tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
patients should be advised to
20 notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
23 Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs andsSymptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in-vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
25 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
in a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-
26 CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / mL .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
27 Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
a lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
the starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
the starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment , should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .

Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .

signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in-vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
39 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
in a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-
40 CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / mL .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
41 Repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
50 3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
51 The following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
52 Symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in-vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
in a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
in a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
in a 12-month recurrence prevention study in manic episode patients who achieved remission on olanzapine and were then randomised to olanzapine or placebo , olanzapine demonstrated statistically
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .

olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
54 prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / mL .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
55 Carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
65 Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in-vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
67 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
in a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450-
68 CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1,000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity
69 In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk for narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti- Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
hepatic function Transient , asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases , ALT , AST have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
caution should be exercised in patients with elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment , in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve , and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic medicines .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow- up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
olanzapine does not inhibit the main CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( e. g .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
79 Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see also section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in-vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5 HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
81 olanzapine produced a higher 5 HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
in a co-therapy study of patients treated with lithium or valproate for a minimum of 2 weeks , the addition of olanzapine 10 mg ( co-therapy with lithium or valproate ) resulted in a greater reduction in symptoms of mania than lithium or valproate monotherapy after 6 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
the absorption is not affected by food .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl
82 metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1,000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate , labored respiration , miosis , and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects
83 were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity Effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
86 Olanzapine Teva Orodispersible Tablet should be placed in the mouth , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva , so it can be easily swallowed .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
alternatively , it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage ( orange juice , apple juice , milk or coffee ) immediately before administration .
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
it has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
in cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary , Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets should be used .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
88 transferase ( AST ) have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the tablets are fragile and should not be pushed through the blister .
the backing should be peeled off to remove the tablet from the blister .
olanzapine Teva orodispersible tablet contains D-glucose : patients with rare glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
Tartrazine lake ( E102 ) :
olanzapine Teva orodispersible tablet contains tartrazine lake ( E102 ) : may cause allergic reactions .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
90 Therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
93 Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
95 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous
96 administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate ,
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity :
effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
olanzapine Teva Orodispersible Tablet should be placed in the mouth , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva , so it can be easily swallowed .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
alternatively , it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage ( orange juice , apple juice , milk or coffee ) immediately before administration .
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
it has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
in cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary , Olanzapine Teva coated tablets should be used .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
caution should be
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the tablets are fragile and should not be pushed through the blister .
the backing should be peeled off to remove the tablet from the blister .
olanzapine Teva orodispersible tablet contains D-glucose : patients with rare glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( See section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
104 General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
107 Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
109 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous
110 administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate ,
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity :
effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
olanzapine Teva Orodispersible Tablet should be placed in the mouth , where it will rapidly disperse in
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
alternatively , it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage ( orange juice , apple juice , milk or coffee ) immediately before administration .
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
it has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
in cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary , Olanzapine Teva coated tablets should be used .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
caution should be
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension Postural hypotension was infrequently observed in the elderly in olanzapine clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the tablets are fragile and should not be pushed through the blister .
the backing should be peeled off to remove the tablet from the blister .
olanzapine Teva orodispersible tablet contains D-glucose : patients with rare glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .

olanzapine Teva orodispersible tablet contains sunset yellow lake ( E110 ) : may cause allergic reactions .
interaction with other medicaments and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is
general CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .

clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
patients gaining 25 of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were very common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
121 Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
123 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous
124 administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate ,
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity :
effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
adults Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
olanzapine is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode .
in patients whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment , olanzapine is indicated for the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder ( see section 5.1 ) .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
adults Schizophrenia :
the recommended starting dose for olanzapine is 10 mg / day .
the starting dose is 15 mg as a single daily dose in monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
preventing recurrence in bipolar disorder :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
for patients who have been receiving olanzapine for treatment of manic episode , continue therapy for preventing recurrence at the same dose .
if a new manic , mixed , or depressive episode occurs , olanzapine treatment should be continued ( with dose optimisation as needed ) , with supplementary therapy to treat mood symptoms , as clinically indicated .
during treatment for schizophrenia , manic episode and recurrence prevention in bipolar disorder , daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status within the range 5- 20 mg / day .
an increase to a dose greater than the recommended starting dose is advised only after appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours .
olanzapine can be given without regards for meals as absorption is not affected by food .
gradual tapering of the dose should be considered when discontinuing olanzapine .
olanzapine Teva Orodispersible Tablet should be placed in the mouth , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva , so it can be easily swallowed .
removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
alternatively , it may be dispersed in a full glass of water or other suitable beverage ( orange juice , apple juice , milk or coffee ) immediately before administration .
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
it has the same dosage and frequency of administration as olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
a greater magnitude of weight gain , lipid and prolactin alterations has been reported in short term studies of adolescent patients than in studies of adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly A lower starting dose ( 5 mg / day ) is not routinely indicated but should be considered for those 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal and / or hepatic impairment A lower starting dose ( 5 mg ) should be considered for such patients .
in cases of moderate hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the starting dose should be 5 mg and only increased with caution .
gender The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for female patients relative to male patients .
smokers The starting dose and dose range need not be routinely altered for non-smokers relative to smokers .
when more than one factor is present which might result in slower metabolism ( female gender , geriatric age , non-smoking status ) , consideration should be given to decreasing the starting dose .
dose escalation , when indicated , should be conservative in such patients .
in cases where dose increments of 2.5 mg are considered necessary , Olanzapine Teva coated tablets should be used .
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 . )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with known risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the higher incidence of death was not associated with olanzapine dose ( mean daily dose 4.4 mg ) or duration of treatment .
however , the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of these risk factors .
in the same clinical trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( CVAE e. g . , stroke , transient ischemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported .
there was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 vs.
all olanzapine- and placebo-treated patients who experienced a cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors .
age &gt; 75 years and vascular / mixed type dementia were identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with olanzapine treatment .
the efficacy of olanzapine was not established in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of olanzapine in the treatment of dopamine agonist associated psychosis in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease is not recommended .
in these trials , patients were initially required to be stable on the lowest effective dose of anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products ( dopamine agonist ) and to remain on the same anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products and dosages throughout the study .
olanzapine was started at 2.5 mg / day and titrated to a maximum of 15 mg / day based on investigator judgement .
neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antipsychotic medicinal product .
rare cases reported as NMS have also been received in association with olanzapine .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis , and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicines , including olanzapine must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and diabetes Hyperglycaemia and / or development or exacerbation of diabetes occasionally associated with ketoacidosis or coma has been reported rarely , including some fatal cases ( see section 4.8 ) .
in some cases , a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor .
appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable particularly in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus for which regular glucose control is recommended .
lipid alterations Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in olanzapine-treated patients in placebo- controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid alterations should be managed as clinically appropriate , particularly in dyslipidemic patients and in patients with risk factors for the development of lipids disorders .
anticholinergic activity While olanzapine demonstrated anticholinergic activity in vitro , experience during the clinical trials revealed a low incidence of related events .
130 transferase ( AST ) have been seen commonly , especially in early treatment .
in the event of elevated ALT and / or AST during treatment , follow-up should be organised and dose reduction should be considered .
in cases where hepatitis ( including hepatocellular , cholestatic or mixed liver injury ) has been diagnosed , olanzapine treatment should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported commonly when olanzapine and valproate are used concomitantly ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea , or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
thromboembolism Temporal association of olanzapine treatment and venous thromboembolism has very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) been reported ..
a causal relationship between the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and treatment with olanzapine has not been established .
however , since patients with schizophrenia often present with acquired risk factors for venous thromboembolism all possible risk factors of VTE e. g. immobilisation of patients , should be identified and preventive measures undertaken .
general CNS activity Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine , caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicines and alcohol .
as it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism , olanzapine may antagonize the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
seizures Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or are subject to factors which may lower the seizure threshold .
seizures have been reported to occur rarely in patients when treated with olanzapine .
in most of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures were reported .
tardive Dyskinesia In comparator studies of one year or less duration , olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant lower incidence of treatment emergent dyskinesia .
however the risk of tardive dyskinesia increases with long term exposure , and therefore if signs or symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine , a dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or even arise after discontinuation of treatment .

131 other antipsychotics , it is recommended that blood pressure is measured periodically in patients over 65 years .
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age Olanzapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of children and adolescents .
studies in patients aged 13-17 years showed various adverse reactions , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and increases in prolactin levels .
long-term outcomes associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the tablets are fragile and should not be pushed through the blister .
the backing should be peeled off to remove the tablet from the blister .
olanzapine Teva orodispersible tablet contains D-glucose : patients with rare glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential interactions affecting olanzapine Since olanzapine is metabolised by CYP1A2 , substances that can specifically induce or inhibit this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of olanzapine may be induced by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced olanzapine concentrations .
only slight to moderate increase in olanzapine clearance has been observed .
the clinical consequences are likely to be limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase of olanzapine dose may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
inhibition of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine , a specific CYP1A2 inhibitor , has been shown to significantly inhibit the metabolism of olanzapine .
the mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine was 54 in female non- smokers and 77 male smokers .
the mean increase in olanzapine AUC was 52 and 108 respectively .
a lower starting dose of olanzapine should be considered in patients who are using fluvoxamine or any other CYP1A2 inhibitors , such as ciprofloxacin .
a decrease in the dose of olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated .
decreased bioavailability Activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral olanzapine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after olanzapine .
fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacid ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine have not been found to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine .
potential for olanzapine to affect other medicinal products Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of direct and indirect dopamine agonists .
1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) .
olanzapine showed no interaction when co-administered with lithium or biperiden .
therapeutic monitoring of valproate plasma levels did not indicate that valproate dosage adjustment is required after the introduction of concomitant olanzapine .
132 General CNS activity Caution should be exercised in patients who consume alcohol or receive medicinal products that can cause central nervous system depression .
the concomitant use of olanzapine with anti-Parkinsonian medicinal products in patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
QTc interval Caution should be used if olanzapine is being administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to increase QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with olanzapine .
nevertheless , because human experience is limited , olanzapine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
spontaneous reports have been very rarely received on tremor , hypertonia , lethargy and sleepiness , in infants born to mothers who had used olanzapine during the 3rd trimester .
in a study in breast-feeding , healthy women , olanzapine was excreted in breast milk .
mean infant exposure ( mg / kg ) at steady state was estimated to be 1.8 of the maternal olanzapine dose ( mg / kg ) .
patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking olanzapine .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because olanzapine may cause somnolence and dizziness , patients should be cautioned about operating machinery , including motor vehicles .
undesirable effects

increased alkaine phosphatase
clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) categories .
weight gain 7 of baseline body weight was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
2 Mean increases in fasting lipid values ( total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and triglycerides ) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline .
3 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2 mmol / l ) to high ( 6.2 mmol / l ) were very common .
4 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 5.56 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 7 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting glucose from borderline at baseline ( 5.56 - &lt; 7 mmol / l ) to high ( 7 mmol / l ) were very common .
5 Observed for fasting normal levels at baseline ( &lt; 1.69 mmol / l ) which increased to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) .
changes in fasting triglycerides from borderline at baseline ( 1.69 mmol / l - &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to high ( 2.26 mmol / l ) were very common .
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of parkinsonism and dystonia in olanzapine-treated patients was numerically higher , but not statistically significantly different from placebo .
olanzapine-treated patients had a lower incidence of parkinsonism , akathisia and dystonia compared with titrated doses of haloperidol .
in the absence of detailed information on the pre-existing history of individual acute and tardive extrapyramidal movement disorders , it can not be concluded at present that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia and / or other tardive extrapyramidal syndromes .
7 Acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiety , nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly .
8 Associated clinical manifestations ( e. g . , gynaecomastia , galactorrhoea , and breast enlargement ) were rare .
in most patients , levels returned to normal ranges without cessation of treatment .
long-term exposure ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who had adverse , clinically significant changes in weight gain , glucose , total / LDL / HDL cholesterol or triglycerides increased over time .
in adult patients who completed 9-12 months of therapy , the rate of increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately 4-6 months .
135 Additional information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients with dementia , olanzapine treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death and cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) .
very common adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine in this patient group were abnormal gait and falls .
pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and urinary incontinence were observed commonly .
in clinical trials in patients with drug-induced ( dopamine agonist ) psychosis associated with Parkinson &apos;s disease , worsening of Parkinsonian symptomatology and hallucinations were reported very commonly and more frequently than with placebo .
in one clinical trial in patients with bipolar mania , valproate combination therapy with olanzapine resulted in an incidence of neutropenia of 4.1 ; a potential contributing factor could be high plasma valproate levels .
olanzapine administered with lithium or valproate resulted in increased levels ( 10 ) of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain .
speech disorder was also reported commonly .
during treatment with olanzapine in combination with lithium or divalproex , an increase of 7 from baseline body weight occurred in 17.4 of patients during acute treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) .
long-term olanzapine treatment ( up to 12 months ) for recurrence prevention in patients with bipolar disorder was associated with an increase of 7 from baseline body weight in 39.9 of patients .
children and adolescents Olanzapine is not indicated for the treatment of children and adolescent patients below 18 years .
although no clinical studies designed to compare adolescents to adults have been conducted , data from the adolescent trials were compared to those of the adult trials .
the following table summarises the adverse reactions reported with a greater frequency in adolescent patients ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult patients or adverse reactions only identified during short-term clinical trials in adolescent patients .
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) appears to occur more frequently in the adolescent population compared to adults with comparable exposures .
the magnitude of weight gain and the proportion of adolescent patients who had clinically significant weight gain were greater with long-term exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than with short-term exposure .
within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
the frequency terms listed are defined as follows :
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :
weight gain9 , elevated triglyceride levels10 , increased appetite .
common :
elevated cholesterol levels11 Nervous system disorders Very common :
sedation ( including : hypersomnia , lethargy , somnolence ) .
dry mouth Hepato-biliary disorders Very common :
elevations of hepatic transaminases ( ALT / AST ; see section 4.4 ) .
Investigations Very common :
decreased total bilirubin , increased GGT , elevated plasma prolactin levels12 .
9 Weight gain 7 of baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common and 15 of baseline body weight was common .
among adolescent patients , mean weight gain was greatest in patients who were overweight or obese at baseline .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from normal at baseline ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were observed commonly .
changes in total fasting cholesterol levels from borderline at baseline ( 4.39 - &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) to high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common .
elevated plasma prolactin levels were reported in 47.4 of adolescent patients .
overdose
signs and symptoms Very common symptoms in overdose ( &gt; 10 incidence ) include tachycardia , agitation / aggressiveness , dysarthria , various extrapyramidal symptoms , and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma .
other medically significant sequelae of overdose include delirium , convulsion , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory depression , aspiration , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( &lt; 2 of overdose cases ) and cardiopulmonary arrest .
fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses as low as 450 mg but survival has also been reported following acute overdose of 1,500 mg .
management of overdose There is no specific antidote for olanzapine .
induction of emesis is not recommended .
standard procedures for management of overdose may be indicated ( i. e. gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) .
the concomitant administration of activated charcoal was shown to reduce the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50 to 60 .
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital organ function should be instituted according to clinical presentation , including treatment of hypotension and circulatory collapse and support of respiratory function .
do not use epinephrine , dopamine , or other sympathomimetic agents with beta- agonist activity since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension .
cardiovascular monitoring is necessary to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
N05A H03 .
olanzapine is an antipsychotic , antimanic and mood stabilising agent that demonstrates a broad pharmacologic profile across a number of receptor systems .
animal behavioral studies with olanzapine indicated 5HT , dopamine , and cholinergic antagonism , consistent with the receptor-binding profile .
olanzapine demonstrated a greater in vitro affinity for serotonin 5HT2 than dopamine D2 receptors and greater 5HT2 than D2 activity in vivo , models .
electrophysiological studies demonstrated that olanzapine selectively reduced the firing of mesolimbic ( A10 ) dopaminergic neurons , while having little effect on the striatal ( A9 ) pathways involved in motor function .
olanzapine reduced a conditioned avoidance response , a test indicative of antipsychotic activity , at doses below those producing catalepsy , an effect indicative of motor side-effects .
unlike some other antipsychotic agents , olanzapine increases responding in an &quot; anxiolytic &quot; test .
137 In a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) Positron Emission tomography ( PET ) study in healthy volunteers , olanzapine produced a higher 5HT2A than dopamine D2 receptor occupancy .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder , olanzapine demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo and valproate semisodium ( divalproex ) in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
olanzapine also demonstrated comparable efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania and depression at 6 and 12 weeks .
olanzapine also showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in terms of preventing either recurrence into mania or recurrence into depression .
olanzapine was used as a flexible dose starting with 2.5 and ranging up to 20 mg / day .
during treatment with olanzapine , adolescents gained significantly more weight compared with adults .
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and prolactin ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) were greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on maintenance of effect and limited data on long term safety ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to olanzapine coated tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
olanzapine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to olanzapine coated tablets .
olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak plasma concentrations within 5 to 8 hours .
absolute oral bioavailability relative to intravenous
138 administration has not been determined
olanzapine is metabolized in the liver by conjugative and oxidative pathways .
the major circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , which does not pass the blood brain barrier .
cytochromes P450- CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 contribute to the formation of the N-desmethyl and 2-hydroxymethyl metabolites , both exhibited significantly less in vivo pharmacological activity than olanzapine in animal studies .
the predominant pharmacologic activity is from the parent olanzapine .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varied on the basis of age and gender .
in healthy elderly ( 65 and over ) versus non-elderly subjects , the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 51.8 versus 33.8 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 17.5 versus 18.2 l / hr ) .
the pharmacokinetic variability observed in the elderly is within the range for the non-elderly .
in 44 patients with schizophrenia &gt; 65 years of age , dosing from 5 to 20 mg / day was not associated with any distinguishing profile of adverse events .
in female versus male subjects the mean elimination half life was somewhat prolonged ( 36.7 versus 32.3 hrs ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.9 versus 27.3 l / hr ) .
however , olanzapine ( 5-20 mg ) demonstrated a comparable safety profile in female ( n = 467 ) as in male patients ( n = 869 ) .
a mass balance study showed that approximately 57 of radiolabelled olanzapine appeared in urine , principally as metabolites .
in non-smoking versus smoking subjects ( males and females ) the mean elimination half-life was prolonged ( 38.6 versus 30.4 hr ) and the clearance was reduced ( 18.6 versus 27.7 l / hr ) .
the plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in elderly versus young subjects , in females versus males , and in non-smokers versus smokers .
however , the magnitude of the impact of age , gender , or smoking on olanzapine clearance and half-life is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals .
in a study of Caucasians , Japanese , and Chinese subjects , there were no differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three populations .
the plasma protein binding of olanzapine was about 93 over the concentration range of about 7 to about 1000 ng / ml .
olanzapine is bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid-glycoprotein .
the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical studies , the average olanzapine exposure was approximately 27 higher in adolescents .
demographic differences between the adolescents and adults include a lower average body weight and fewer adolescents were smokers .
such factors possibly contribute to the higher average exposure observed in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute ( single-dose ) toxicity Signs of oral toxicity in rodents were characteristic of potent neuroleptic compounds : hypoactivity , coma , tremors , clonic convulsions , salivation , and depressed weight gain .
the median lethal doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mice ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without mortality .
clinical signs included sedation , ataxia , tremors , increased heart rate ,
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg resulted in prostration and , at higher doses , semi-consciousness .
repeated-dose toxicity In studies up to 3 months duration in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the predominant effects were CNS depression , anticholinergic effects , and peripheral haematological disorders .
tolerance developed to the CNS depression .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
reversible effects consistent with elevated prolactin in rats included decreased weights of ovaries and uterus and morphologic changes in vaginal epithelium and in mammary gland .
haematologic toxicity :
effects on haematology parameters were found in each species , including dose-related reductions in circulating leukocytes in mice and non-specific reductions of circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found .
in cytopenic dogs , there were no adverse effects on progenitor and proliferating cells in the bone marrow .
reproductive toxicity Olanzapine had no teratogenic effects .
sedation affected mating performance of male rats .
in the offspring of rats given olanzapine , delays in fetal development and transient decreases in offspring activity levels were seen .
mutagenicity Olanzapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a full range of standard tests , which included bacterial mutation tests and in vitro and in vivo mammalian tests .
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it was concluded that olanzapine is not carcinogenic .

European PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
it explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
if you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
if you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Omnitrope ?
Omnitrope is a medicine containing the active substance somatropin .
it is available as a powder and solvent , which are made up into a solution for injection ( 1.3 or 5 mg / ml ) , or as a ready-to-use solution in a cartridge ( 3.3 or 6.7 mg / ml ) .
this means that Omnitrope is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also known as the reference medicine ) .
the reference medicine for Omnitrope is Genotropin .
for more information on biosimilar medicines , see the question-and-answer document here .
what is Omnitrope used for ?
the diagnosis must be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing .
Omnitrope is also used to treat adult patients with pronounced GH deficiency as replacement therapy .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Omnitrope used ?
Omnitrope treatment should be supervised by a doctor experienced in the management of patients with growth disorders .
Omnitrope is given by subcutaneous injection ( under the skin ) , once a day at bedtime .
the patient or caregiver can inject Omnitrope themselves , after training by a doctor or a nurse .
the Omnitrope cartridges should only be used with the special Omnitrope injection device .
the doctor calculates the dose for each patient individually , depending on the body weight and the condition being treated .
the dose may need to be adjusted over time , depending on change in body weight and response .
it promotes growth during childhood and adolescence , and also acts on the way the body handles proteins , fat and 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. carbohydrates .
the active substance in Omnitrope , somatropin , is identical to the human GH .
it is produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology : the hormone is made by a bacterium which has received a gene ( DNA ) that makes it able to produce it .
Omnitrope replaces the natural hormone .
how has Omnitrope been studied ?
Omnitrope was studied to show that it is comparable to the reference medicine , Genotropin .
Omnitrope was compared to Genotropin in 89 children with a lack of GH and who had not been treated before .
the study lasted nine months , and measured the height at the beginning and the end of the study , and the speed of growth during the study .
to study the safety of Omnitrope , another 51 children have also received the medicine for up to a year .
what benefit has Omnitrope shown during the studies ?
after nine months , treatment with Omnitrope and Genotropin gave similar increases in height and speed of growth ( equivalent to an increase of 10.7 cm per year with both medicines ) .
the effectiveness of Omnitrope has been shown to be equivalent to that of Genotropin .
what is the risk associated with Omnitrope ?
the side effects seen with Omnitrope were similar in type and severity to those seen with the reference medicine Genotropin .
in addition , as with all protein medicines , some patients may develop antibodies ( proteins that are produced in response to Omnitrope ) .
however these have no growth-inhibiting effects .
for the full list of all side effects reported with Omnitrope , see the Package Leaflet .
Omnitrope should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to somatropin or any of the other ingredients ( the ready-to-use solution and the solvent for Omnitrope 5 mg / ml contain benzyl alcohol ) .
Omnitrope should not be used when the patient suffers from an active tumour or an acute life-threatening illness .
for the full list of restrictions , see the Package Leaflet .
somatropin may interfere with the body &apos;s use of insulin .
blood sugar levels will need to be checked during treatment , and treatment with insulin may sometimes need to be adjusted or started .
why has Omnitrope been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) considered that , in accordance with EU requirements , Omnitrope has been shown to have a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile to Genotropin .
therefore , the CHMP &apos;s view was that , as for Genotropin , the benefit outweighs the identified risk .
which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Omnitrope ?
the measures taken to ensure the safe use of Omnitrope are linked to the reasons why the medicine is used .
other information about Omnitrope :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Omnitrope to Sandoz GmbH on 12 April 2006 .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
infants , children and adolescents
- Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone ( GH ) .
- Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome .
- Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency .
- Growth disturbance ( current height standard deviation score ( SDS ) &lt; -2.5 and parental adjusted
diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing .
adults
- Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency .
patients with
severe growth hormone deficiency in adulthood are defined as patients with known hypothalamic pituitary pathology and at least one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin .
these patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone deficiency .
the cut-off point of the dynamic test should be strict .
posology and method of administration
diagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders .
the posology and administration schedule should be individualised .
even higher doses have been used .
generally a dose of 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg / m2 body surface area per day is recommended .
daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded .
treatment should not be used in paediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses .
a dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg / m2 body surface area per day is recommended .
a dose of 1.4 mg / m2 body surface area per day ( 0.045 - 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) is recommended .
higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low .
a dose correction may be needed after six months of treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below 1 .

gestational age ( SGA )
growth hormone deficient adult patients :
therapy should start with a low dose , 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day .
treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I ) concentrations within 2 SDS from the age corrected mean of healthy adults .
patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment should be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal , not exceeding the 2 SDS .
clinical response and undesirable effects may also be used as guidance for dose titration .
the daily maintenance dose rarely exceeds 1.0 mg per day .
women may require higher doses than men , while men show an increasing IGF-I sensitivity over time .
this means that there is a risk that women , especially those on oral oestrogen replacement are under-treated while men are over-treated .
the accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every 6 months .
as normal physiological growth hormone production decreases with age , dose requirements may be reduced .
the minimum effective dose should be used .
the injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy .
for instructions for use and handling see section 6.6 .
Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to somatropin or to any of the excipients .
- Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity and anti-tumour
therapy must be completed prior to starting therapy .
- Somatropin must not be used for growth promotion in patients with closed epiphyses .
- Patients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery ,
abdominal surgery , multiple accidental trauma , acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated with somatropin .
with regard to patients undergoing substitution therapy , see section 4.4 .
special warnings and precautions for use
somatropin may induce a state of insulin resistance and in some patients hyperglycaemia .
therefore patients should be observed for evidence of glucose intolerance .
in patients with already manifested diabetes mellitus , the anti-diabetic therapy might require adjustment when somatropin is instituted .
during treatment with somatropin , an enhanced T4 to T3 conversion has been found which may result in a reduction in serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations .
in general , the peripheral thyroid hormone levels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects .
the effects of somatropin on thyroid hormone levels may be of clinical relevance in patients with central subclinical hypothyroidism in whom hypothyroidism theoretically may develop .
conversely , in patients receiving replacement therapy with thyroxin mild hyperthyroidism may occur .
it is therefore particularly advisable to test thyroid function after starting treatment with somatropin and after dose adjustments .
somatropin has been reported to reduce serum cortisol levels , possibly by affecting carrier proteins or by increasing hepatic clearance .
the clinical relevance of these findings may be limited .
nevertheless , corticosteroid replacement therapy should be optimised before initiation of Omnitrope therapy .
in growth hormone deficiency , secondary to treatment of malignant disease , it is recommended to pay attention to signs of relapse of the malignancy .
in patients with endocrine disorders , including growth hormone deficiency , slipped epiphyses of the hip may occur more frequently than in the general population .
patients limping during treatment with somatropin , should be examined clinically .
in case of severe or recurrent headache , visual problems , nausea and / or vomiting , a fundoscopy for papilloedema is recommended .
if papilloedema is confirmed , a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension should be considered and , if appropriate , the growth hormone treatment should be discontinued .
at present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension .
however , clinical experience has shown that reinstitution of the therapy is often possible without recurrence of the intracranial hypertension .
if growth hormone treatment is restarted , careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary .
experience in patients above 60 years is limited .
in patients with PWS , treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet .
patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk .
patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper airway obstruction , sleep apnoea or respiratory infections before initiation of treatment with somatropin .
4 In case of signs of upper airway obstruction , the problem should be solved by a specialist before starting treatment with somatropin .
sleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods such as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry , and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
if during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction ( including onset of or increased snoring ) , treatment should be interrupted , and a new ENT assessment performed .
all patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
all patients with PWS should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively .
all patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during treatment with somatropin .
scoliosis is common in patients with PWS .
scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth .
signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment .
however , growth hormone treatment has not been shown to increase the incidence or severity of scoliosis .
experience with long term treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited .
in short children / adolescents born SGA , other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth disturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before start of treatment and annually thereafter .
in patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus ( e. g. familial history of diabetes , obesity , severe insulin resistance , acanthosis nigricans ) oral glucose tolerance testing ( OGTT ) should be performed .
if overt diabetes occurs , growth hormone should not be administered .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment and twice a year thereafter .
if on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed 2 SD compared to references for age and pubertal status , the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to consider dose adjustment .
experience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited .
it is therefore not recommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty .
experience in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome is limited .
some of the height gain obtained with treating short children / adolescents born SGA with growth hormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached .
in chronic renal insufficiency , renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution of therapy .
to verify growth disturbance , growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of therapy .
during this period , conservative treatment for renal insufficiency ( which includes control of acidosis , hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status ) should have been established and should be maintained during treatment .
the treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation .
to date , no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are available .
based on this information , these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin .
as there is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill patients , the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential risks involved .
in all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness , the possible benefit of treatment with somatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 ( e. g. sex steroids , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and ciclosporin ) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds .
the clinical significance of this is unknown .
also see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for statement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
for Omnitrope no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available .
animal experimental data on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available .
treatment with Omnitrope should be interrupted if pregnancy occurs .
during normal pregnancy levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 gestation weeks , being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks .
in view of this , it is unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth hormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy .
it is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk , but absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely .
caution should be exercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
patients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit .
when treatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected .
in adult patients , adverse reactions related to fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , stiffness in the extremities , arthralgia , myalgia and paraesthesia are common .
in general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate , arise within the first months of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction .
the incidence of these undesirable effects is related to the administered dose , the age of patients , and possibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency .
in paediatric patients such undesirable effects are uncommon .
6 Neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps )
very rare :
leukemia .
very rare cases of leukaemia have been reported in growth hormone deficient paediatric patients treated with somatropin , but the incidence appears to be similar to that in the paediatric subjects without growth hormone deficiency .
immune system disorders
common :
formation of antibodies .
somatropin has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of the patients .
the binding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with their formation .
endocrine disorders
diabetes mellitus type II
nervous system disorders

Uncommon :
in paediatric patients : peripheral oedema
overdose
no case of overdose has been reported .
acute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia .
long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human growth hormone excess .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues .
ATC code :
somatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids , carbohydrates and proteins .
in children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone , somatropin stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate .
in adults as well as in children , somatropin maintains a normal body composition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth , and by mobilisation of body fat .
visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin .
in addition to enhanced lipolysis , somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores .
serum concentrations of IGF-I ( Insulin-like Growth Factor-I ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) are increased by somatropin .
in addition , the following actions have been demonstrated .
7 Lipid metabolism :
somatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors , and affects the profile of serum lipids and lipoproteins .
in general , administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in reduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B.
a reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be observed .
carbohydrate metabolism :
somatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged .
this condition is reversed by somatropin .
water and mineral metabolism :
both are rapidly increased after treatment with somatropin .
somatropin induces the retention of sodium , potassium and phosphorus .
bone metabolism :
somatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone .
long-term administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients with osteopoenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and density at weight-bearing sites .
physical capacity :
muscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with somatropin .
somatropin also increases cardiac output , but the mechanism has yet to be clarified .
a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect .
in clinical trials in short children / adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg somatropin / kg body weight per day have been used for treatment until final height is reached .
literature data from untreated SGA children / adolescents without early spontaneous catch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS .
long-term safety data are still limited .
pharmacokinetic properties
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80 in both healthy subjects and growth hormone deficient patients .
elimination The mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone deficient adults is about 0.4 hours .
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope powder and solvent for solution for injection , a half-life of 3 hours is achieved .
sub-populations The absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following subcutaneous administration .
information about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations , in different races and in patients with renal , hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or incomplete .
preclinical safety data
in studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance , no clinically relevant effects have been observed .
8 In other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity , local tolerance and reproduction toxicity no clinically relevant effects have been observed .
with somatropins , in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of chromosome aberrations have been negative .
an increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken from patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the radiomimetic medicinal product bleomycin .
the clinical significance of this finding is unclear .
in another study with somatropin , no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the lymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy .

in patients with already manifested diabetes mellitus , the anti-diabetic therapy might require adjustment when somatropin is instituted .
during treatment with somatropin , an enhanced T4 to T3 conversion has been found which may result in a reduction in serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations .
in general , the peripheral thyroid hormone levels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects .
the effects of somatropin on thyroid hormone levels may be of clinical relevance in patients with central subclinical hypothyroidism in whom hypothyroidism theoretically may develop .
conversely , in patients receiving replacement therapy with thyroxin mild hyperthyroidism may occur .
it is therefore particularly advisable to test thyroid function after starting treatment with somatropin and after dose adjustments .
somatropin has been reported to reduce serum cortisol levels , possibly by affecting carrier proteins or by increasing hepatic clearance .
the clinical relevance of these findings may be limited .
nevertheless , corticosteroid replacement therapy should be optimised before initiation of Omnitrope therapy .
in growth hormone deficiency , secondary to treatment of malignant disease , it is recommended to pay attention to signs of relapse of the malignancy .
in patients with endocrine disorders , including growth hormone deficiency , slipped epiphyses of the hip may occur more frequently than in the general population .
patients limping during treatment with somatropin , should be examined clinically .
in case of severe or recurrent headache , visual problems , nausea and / or vomiting , a fundoscopy for papilloedema is recommended .
if papilloedema is confirmed , a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension should be considered and , if appropriate , the growth hormone treatment should be discontinued .
at present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension .
however , clinical experience has shown that reinstitution of the therapy is often possible without recurrence of the intracranial hypertension .
if growth hormone treatment is restarted , careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary .
experience in patients above 60 years is limited .
in patients with PWS , treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet .
patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk .
patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper airway obstruction , sleep apnoea or respiratory infections before initiation of treatment with somatropin .
13 In case of signs of upper airway obstruction , the problem should be solved by a specialist before starting treatment with somatropin .
sleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods such as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry , and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
if during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction ( including onset of or increased snoring ) , treatment should be interrupted , and a new ENT assessment performed .
all patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
all patients with PWS should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively .
all patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during treatment with somatropin .
scoliosis is common in patients with PWS .
scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth .
signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment .
however , growth hormone treatment has not been shown to increase the incidence or severity of scoliosis .
experience with long term treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited .
in short children / adolescents born SGA , other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth disturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before start of treatment and annually thereafter .
in patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus ( e. g. familial history of diabetes , obesity , severe insulin resistance , acanthosis nigricans ) oral glucose tolerance testing ( OGTT ) should be performed .
if overt diabetes occurs , growth hormone should not be administered .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment and twice a year thereafter .
if on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed 2 SD compared to references for age and pubertal status , the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to consider dose adjustment .
experience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited .
it is therefore not recommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty .
experience in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome is limited .
some of the height gain obtained with treating short children / adolescents born SGA with growth hormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached .
in chronic renal insufficiency , renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution of therapy .
to verify growth disturbance , growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of therapy .
during this period , conservative treatment for renal insufficiency ( which includes control of acidosis , hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status ) should have been established and should be maintained during treatment .
the treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation .
to date , no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are available .
based on this information , these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin .
as there is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill patients , the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential risks involved .
in all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness , the possible benefit of treatment with somatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
because of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature babies or neonates .
it may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 ( e. g. sex steroids , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and ciclosporin ) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds .
the clinical significance of this is unknown .
also see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for statement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
for Omnitrope no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available .
animal experimental data on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available .
treatment with Omnitrope should be interrupted if pregnancy occurs .
during normal pregnancy levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 gestation weeks , being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks .
in view of this , it is unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth hormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy .
it is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk , but absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely .
caution should be exercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
patients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit .
when treatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected .
in adult patients , adverse reactions related to fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , stiffness in the extremities , arthralgia , myalgia and paraesthesia are common .
in general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate , arise within the first months of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction .
the incidence of these undesirable effects is related to the administered dose , the age of patients , and possibly inversely
in paediatric patients such undesirable effects are uncommon .
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps )
very rare :
leukemia .
very rare cases of leukaemia have been reported in growth hormone deficient paediatric patients treated with somatropin , but the incidence appears to be similar to that in the paediatric subjects without growth hormone deficiency .
immune system disorders
common :
formation of antibodies .
somatropin has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of the patients .
the binding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with their formation .
endocrine disorders
diabetes mellitus type II
nervous system disorders
common :
Uncommon :
in adults : paraesthesia In adults : carpal tunnel syndrome ; In paediatric patients : paraesthesia Benign intracranial hypertension
musculoskeletal
and connective tissue disorders
Uncommon :
in adults : stiffness in the extremities , arthralgia , myalgia In paediatric patients : stiffness in the extremities , arthralgia , myalgia
general disorders and administration site conditions
common :
in adults : peripheral oedema ; In paediatric patients : transient local skin reactions at the injection site
Uncommon :
in paediatric patients : peripheral oedema
overdose
no case of overdose has been reported .
acute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia .
long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human growth hormone excess .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues .
ATC code :
somatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids , carbohydrates and proteins .
in children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone , somatropin stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate .
in adults as well as in children , somatropin maintains a normal body composition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth , and by mobilisation of body fat .
visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin .
16 concentrations of IGF-I ( Insulin-like Growth Factor-I ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) are increased by somatropin .
in addition , the following actions have been demonstrated .
lipid metabolism :
somatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors , and affects the profile of serum lipids and lipoproteins .
in general , administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in reduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B.
a reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be observed .
carbohydrate metabolism :
somatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged .
this condition is reversed by somatropin .
water and mineral metabolism :
both are rapidly increased after treatment with somatropin .
somatropin induces the retention of sodium , potassium and phosphorus .
bone metabolism :
somatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone .
long-term administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients with osteopoenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and density at weight-bearing sites .
physical capacity :
muscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with somatropin .
somatropin also increases cardiac output , but the mechanism has yet to be clarified .
a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect .
in clinical trials in short children / adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg somatropin / kg body weight per day have been used for treatment until final height is reached .
literature data from untreated SGA children / adolescents without early spontaneous catch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS .
long-term safety data are still limited .
pharmacokinetic properties
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80 in both healthy subjects and growth hormone deficient patients .
elimination The mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone deficient adults is about 0.4 hours .
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 5 mg / ml powder and solvent for solution for injection , a half-life of 3 hours is achieved .
sub-populations The absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following subcutaneous administration .
17 Information about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations , in different races and in patients with renal , hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or incomplete .
preclinical safety data
in studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance , no clinically relevant effects have been observed .
in other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity , local tolerance and reproduction toxicity no clinically relevant effects have been observed .
with somatropins , in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of chromosome aberrations have been negative .
an increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken from patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the radiomimetic medicinal product bleomycin .
the clinical significance of this finding is unclear .
in another study with somatropin , no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the lymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
infants , children and adolescents
- Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone ( GH ) .
- Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome .
- Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency .
- Growth disturbance ( current height standard deviation score ( SDS ) &lt; -2.5 and parental adjusted
diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing .
adults
patients with
severe growth hormone deficiency in adulthood are defined as patients with known hypothalamic pituitary pathology and at least one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin .
these patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone deficiency .
the cut-off point of the dynamic test should be strict .
posology and method of administration
diagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders .
the posology and administration schedule should be individualised .
even higher doses have been used .
generally a dose of 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg / m2 body surface area per day is recommended .
daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded .
treatment should not be used in paediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses .
a dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg / m2 body surface area per day is recommended .
a dose of 1.4 mg / m2 body surface area per day ( 0.045 - 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) is recommended .
higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low .
a dose correction may be needed after six months of treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below 1 .
dose recommendations for paediatric patients
growth hormone deficiency Prader-Willi syndrome Turner syndrome Chronic renal insufficiency Children / adolescents born small for
per day 0.025 - 0.035 0.035 0.045 - 0.050 0.045 - 0.050
dose per day 0.7 - 1.0 1.0 1.4 1.4
gestational age ( SGA )
growth hormone deficient adult patients :
therapy should start with a low dose , 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day .
treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I ) concentrations within 2 SDS from the age corrected mean of healthy adults .
patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment should be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal , not exceeding the 2 SDS .
clinical response and undesirable effects may also be used as guidance for dose titration .
the daily maintenance dose rarely exceeds 1.0 mg per day .
women may require higher doses than men , while men show an increasing IGF-I sensitivity over time .
this means that there is a risk that women , especially those on oral oestrogen replacement are under-treated while men are over-treated .
the accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every 6 months .
as normal physiological growth hormone production decreases with age , dose requirements may be reduced .
the minimum effective dose should be used .
the injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy .
for instructions for use and handling see section 6.6 .
Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to somatropin or to any of the excipients .
- Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity and anti-tumour
therapy must be completed prior to starting therapy .
- Somatropin must not be used for growth promotion in patients with closed epiphyses .
- Patients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery ,
special warnings and precautions for use
somatropin may induce a state of insulin resistance and in some patients hyperglycaemia .
therefore patients should be observed for evidence of glucose intolerance .
in patients with already manifested diabetes mellitus , the anti-diabetic therapy might require adjustment when somatropin is instituted .
during treatment with somatropin , an enhanced T4 to T3 conversion has been found which may result in a reduction in serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations .

patients limping during treatment with somatropin , should be examined clinically .
in case of severe or recurrent headache , visual problems , nausea and / or vomiting , a fundoscopy for papilloedema is recommended .
if papilloedema is confirmed , a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension should be considered and , if appropriate , the growth hormone treatment should be discontinued .
at present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension .
however , clinical experience has shown that reinstitution of the therapy is often possible without recurrence of the intracranial hypertension .
if growth hormone treatment is restarted , careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary .
experience in patients above 60 years is limited .
in patients with PWS , treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet .
patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk .
patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper airway obstruction , sleep apnoea or respiratory infections before initiation of treatment with somatropin .
23 In case of signs of upper airway obstruction , the problem should be solved by a specialist before starting treatment with somatropin .
sleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods such as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry , and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
if during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction ( including onset of or increased snoring ) , treatment should be interrupted , and a new ENT assessment performed .
all patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
all patients with PWS should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively .
all patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during treatment with somatropin .
scoliosis is common in patients with PWS .
scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth .
signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment .
however , growth hormone treatment has not been shown to increase the incidence or severity of scoliosis .
experience with long term treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited .
in short children / adolescents born SGA , other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth disturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before start of treatment and annually thereafter .
in patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus ( e. g. familial history of diabetes , obesity , severe insulin resistance , acanthosis nigricans ) oral glucose tolerance testing ( OGTT ) should be performed .
if overt diabetes occurs , growth hormone should not be administered .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment and twice a year thereafter .
if on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed 2 SD compared to references for age and pubertal status , the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to consider dose adjustment .

because of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature babies or neonates .
it may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 ( e. g. sex steroids , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and ciclosporin ) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds .
the clinical significance of this is unknown .
also see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for statement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
for Omnitrope no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available .
animal experimental data on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available .
treatment with Omnitrope should be interrupted if pregnancy occurs .
during normal pregnancy levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 gestation weeks , being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks .
in view of this , it is unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth hormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy .
it is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk , but absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely .
caution should be exercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .

name OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
somatropin 6.7 mg ( corresponding to 20 IU ) / ml .
one cartridge contains 1.5 ml corresponding to 10 mg Somatropin ( 30 IU ) .
produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
solution for injection The solution is clear and colourless .
clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
infants , children and adolescents
- Growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone ( GH ) .
- Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome .
- Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency .
- Growth disturbance ( current height standard deviation score ( SDS ) &lt; -2.5 and parental adjusted
diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing .
adults
patients with
severe growth hormone deficiency in adulthood are defined as patients with known hypothalamic pituitary pathology and at least one known deficiency of a pituitary hormone not being prolactin .
these patients should undergo a single dynamic test in order to diagnose or exclude a growth hormone deficiency .
the cut-off point of the dynamic test should be strict .
posology and method of administration
diagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders .
the posology and administration schedule should be individualised .
even higher doses have been used .
generally a dose of 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day or 1.0 mg / m2 body surface area per day is recommended .
daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded .
treatment should not be used in paediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and near closure of epiphyses .
a dose of 0.045 - 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day or 1.4 mg / m2 body surface area per day is recommended .
a dose of 1.4 mg / m2 body surface area per day ( 0.045 - 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) is recommended .
higher doses may be needed if growth velocity is too low .
a dose correction may be needed after six months of treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the height velocity SDS is below 1 .
dose recommendations for paediatric patients
indication Growth hormone deficiency Prader-Willi syndrome Turner syndrome Chronic renal insufficiency Children / adolescents born small for gestational age ( SGA )
mg / kg body weight dose per day 0.025 - 0.035 0.035 0.045 - 0.050 0.045 - 0.050 0.035
mg / m area
growth hormone deficient adult patients :
therapy should start with a low dose , 0.15 - 0.3 mg per day .
treatment goal should be insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I ) concentrations within 2 SDS from the age corrected mean of healthy adults .
patients with normal IGF-I concentrations at the start of the treatment should be administered growth hormone up to an IGF-I level into the upper range of normal , not exceeding the 2 SDS .
clinical response and undesirable effects may also be used as guidance for dose titration .
the daily maintenance dose rarely exceeds 1.0 mg per day .
women may require higher doses than men , while men show an increasing IGF-I sensitivity over time .
this means that there is a risk that women , especially those on oral oestrogen replacement are under-treated while men are over-treated .
the accuracy of the growth hormone dose should therefore be controlled every 6 months .
as normal physiological growth hormone production decreases with age , dose requirements may be reduced .
the minimum effective dose should be used .
the injection should be given subcutaneously and the site varied to prevent lipoatrophy .
for instructions for use and handling see section 6.6 .
Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to somatropin or to any of the excipients .
- Somatropin must not be used when there is any evidence of tumour activity and anti-tumour
therapy must be completed prior to starting therapy .
- Somatropin must not be used for growth promotion in patients with closed epiphyses .
- Patients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery ,
special warnings and precautions for use
somatropin may induce a state of insulin resistance and in some patients hyperglycaemia .
therefore patients should be observed for evidence of glucose intolerance .
in patients with already manifested diabetes mellitus , the anti-diabetic therapy might require adjustment when somatropin is instituted .
during treatment with somatropin , an enhanced T4 to T3 conversion has been found which may result in a reduction in serum T4 and an increase in serum T3 concentrations .
in general , the peripheral thyroid hormone levels have remained within the reference ranges for healthy subjects .
the effects of somatropin on thyroid hormone levels may be of clinical relevance in patients with central subclinical hypothyroidism in whom hypothyroidism theoretically may develop .
conversely , in patients receiving replacement therapy with thyroxin mild hyperthyroidism may occur .
it is therefore particularly advisable to test thyroid function after starting treatment with somatropin and after dose adjustments .
somatropin has been reported to reduce serum cortisol levels , possibly by affecting carrier proteins or by increasing hepatic clearance .
the clinical relevance of these findings may be limited .
nevertheless , corticosteroid replacement therapy should be optimised before initiation of Omnitrope therapy .
in growth hormone deficiency , secondary to treatment of malignant disease , it is recommended to pay attention to signs of relapse of the malignancy .
in patients with endocrine disorders , including growth hormone deficiency , slipped epiphyses of the hip may occur more frequently than in the general population .
patients limping during treatment with somatropin , should be examined clinically .
in case of severe or recurrent headache , visual problems , nausea and / or vomiting , a fundoscopy for papilloedema is recommended .
if papilloedema is confirmed , a diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension should be considered and , if appropriate , the growth hormone treatment should be discontinued .
at present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved intracranial hypertension .
however , clinical experience has shown that reinstitution of the therapy is often possible without recurrence of the intracranial hypertension .
if growth hormone treatment is restarted , careful monitoring for symptoms of intracranial hypertension is necessary .
experience in patients above 60 years is limited .
in patients with PWS , treatment should always be in combination with a calorie-restricted diet .
patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk .
patients with PWS should be evaluated for upper airway obstruction , sleep apnoea or respiratory infections before initiation of treatment with somatropin .
32 In case of signs of upper airway obstruction , the problem should be solved by a specialist before starting treatment with somatropin .
sleep apnoea should be assessed before onset of growth hormone treatment by recognised methods such as polysomnography or overnight oxymetry , and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
if during treatment with somatropin patients show signs of upper airway obstruction ( including onset of or increased snoring ) , treatment should be interrupted , and a new ENT assessment performed .
all patients with PWS should be evaluated for sleep apnoea and monitored if sleep apnoea is suspected .
all patients with PWS should be monitored for signs of respiratory infections which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively .
all patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during treatment with somatropin .
scoliosis is common in patients with PWS .
scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth .
signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment .
however , growth hormone treatment has not been shown to increase the incidence or severity of scoliosis .
experience with long term treatment in adults and in patients with PWS is limited .
in short children / adolescents born SGA , other medical reasons or treatments that could explain growth disturbance should be ruled out before starting treatment .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure fasting insulin and blood glucose before start of treatment and annually thereafter .
in patients with increased risk for diabetes mellitus ( e. g. familial history of diabetes , obesity , severe insulin resistance , acanthosis nigricans ) oral glucose tolerance testing ( OGTT ) should be performed .
if overt diabetes occurs , growth hormone should not be administered .
in SGA children / adolescents it is recommended to measure the IGF-I level before start of treatment and twice a year thereafter .
if on repeated measurements IGF-I levels exceed 2 SD compared to references for age and pubertal status , the IGF-I / IGFBP-3 ratio could be taken into account to consider dose adjustment .
experience in initiating treatment in SGA patients near onset of puberty is limited .
it is therefore not recommended to initiate treatment near onset of puberty .
experience in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome is limited .
some of the height gain obtained with treating short children / adolescents born SGA with growth hormone may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached .
in chronic renal insufficiency , renal function should be below 50 percent of normal before institution of therapy .
to verify growth disturbance , growth should be followed for a year preceding institution of therapy .
during this period , conservative treatment for renal insufficiency ( which includes control of acidosis , hyperparathyroidism and nutritional status ) should have been established and should be maintained during treatment .
the treatment should be discontinued at renal transplantation .
to date , no data on final height in patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with Omnitrope are available .
based on this information , these types of patients should not be treated with somatropin .
as there is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in acutely critically ill patients , the benefits of continued treatment in this situation should be weighed against the potential risks involved .
in all patients developing other or similar acute critical illness , the possible benefit of treatment with somatropin must be weighed against the potential risk involved .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
data from an interaction study performed in growth hormone deficient adults suggests that somatropin administration may increase the clearance of compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P 450 3A4 ( e. g. sex steroids , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and ciclosporin ) may be especially increased resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds .
the clinical significance of this is unknown .
also see section 4.4 for statements regarding diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder and section 4.2 for statement on oral oestrogen replacement therapy .
pregnancy and lactation
for Omnitrope no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available .
animal experimental data on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available .
treatment with Omnitrope should be interrupted if pregnancy occurs .
during normal pregnancy levels of pituitary growth hormone fall markedly after 20 gestation weeks , being replaced almost entirely by placental growth hormone by 30 weeks .
in view of this , it is unlikely that continued replacement therapy with somatropin would be necessary in growth hormone deficient women in the third trimester of pregnancy .
it is not known if somatropin is excreted into breast milk , but absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is extremely unlikely .
caution should be exercised when Omnitrope is administered to breast-feeding women .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
patients with growth hormone deficiency are characterised by extracellular volume deficit .
when treatment with somatropin is started this deficit is rapidly corrected .
in adult patients , adverse reactions related to fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , stiffness in the extremities , arthralgia , myalgia and paraesthesia are common .
in general these adverse reactions are mild to moderate , arise within the first months of treatment and subside spontaneously or with dose-reduction .
the incidence of these undesirable effects is related to the administered dose , the age of patients , and possibly inversely related to the age of patients at the onset of growth hormone deficiency .
in paediatric patients such undesirable effects are uncommon .
34 Neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps )
very rare :
leukemia .
very rare cases of leukaemia have been reported in growth hormone deficient paediatric patients treated with somatropin , but the incidence appears to be similar to that in the paediatric subjects without growth hormone deficiency .
immune system disorders
common :
formation of antibodies .
somatropin has given rise to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of the patients .
the binding capacity of these antibodies has been low and no clinical changes have been associated with their formation .
endocrine disorders
diabetes mellitus type II
nervous system disorders
common :
Uncommon :
in adults : paraesthesia In adults : carpal tunnel syndrome ; In paediatric patients : paraesthesia Benign intracranial hypertension
and connective tissue disorders
common :
Uncommon :
in adults : stiffness in the extremities , arthralgia , myalgia In paediatric patients : stiffness in the extremities , arthralgia , myalgia
general disorders and administration site conditions
common :
in adults : peripheral oedema ; In paediatric patients : transient local skin reactions at the injection site
Uncommon :
in paediatric patients : peripheral oedema
overdose
no case of overdose has been reported .
acute overdose could lead initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia .
long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms consistent with the known effects of human growth hormone excess .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : anterior pituitary lobe hormones and analogues .
ATC code :
somatropin is a potent metabolic hormone of importance for the metabolism of lipids , carbohydrates and proteins .
in children with inadequate endogenous growth hormone , somatropin stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate .
in adults as well as in children , somatropin maintains a normal body composition by increasing nitrogen retention and stimulation of skeletal muscle growth , and by mobilisation of body fat .
visceral adipose tissue is particularly responsive to somatropin .
in addition to enhanced lipolysis , somatropin decreases the uptake of triglycerides into body fat stores .
serum concentrations of IGF-I ( Insulin-like Growth Factor-I ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) are increased by somatropin .
in addition , the following actions have been demonstrated .
35 Lipid metabolism :
somatropin induces hepatic LDL cholesterol receptors , and affects the profile of serum lipids and lipoproteins .
in general , administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients results in reduction in serum LDL and apolipoprotein B.
a reduction in serum total cholesterol may also be observed .
carbohydrate metabolism :
somatropin increases insulin but fasting blood glucose is commonly unchanged .
this condition is reversed by somatropin .
water and mineral metabolism :
both are rapidly increased after treatment with somatropin .
somatropin induces the retention of sodium , potassium and phosphorus .
bone metabolism :
somatropin stimulates the turnover of skeletal bone .
long-term administration of somatropin to growth hormone deficient patients with osteopoenia results in an increase in bone mineral content and density at weight-bearing sites .
physical capacity :
muscle strength and physical exercise capacity are improved after long-term treatment with somatropin .
somatropin also increases cardiac output , but the mechanism has yet to be clarified .
a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect .
in clinical trials in short children / adolescents born SGA doses of 0.033 and 0.067 mg somatropin / kg body weight per day have been used for treatment until final height is reached .
literature data from untreated SGA children / adolescents without early spontaneous catch-up suggest a late growth of 0.5 SDS .
long-term safety data are still limited .
pharmacokinetic properties
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered somatropin is approximately 80 in both healthy subjects and growth hormone deficient patients .
a subcutaneous dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection in healthy adults results in plasma Cmax and tmax values of 74 22 g / l and 3.9 1.2 hours , respectively .
elimination The mean terminal half-life of somatropin after intravenous administration in growth hormone deficient adults is about 0.4 hours .
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection , a half-life of 3 hours is achieved .
sub-populations The absolute bioavailability of somatropin seems to be similar in males and females following subcutaneous administration .
information about the pharmacokinetics of somatropin in geriatric and paediatric populations , in different races and in patients with renal , hepatic or cardiac insufficiency is either lacking or incomplete .
preclinical safety data
in studies with Omnitrope regarding subacute toxicity and local tolerance , no clinically relevant effects have been observed .
36 In other studies with somatropin regarding general toxicity , local tolerance and reproduction toxicity no clinically relevant effects have been observed .
with somatropins , in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies on gene mutations and induction of chromosome aberrations have been negative .
an increased chromosome fragility has been observed in one in vitro study on lymphocytes taken from patients after long term treatment with somatropin and following the addition of the radiomimetic medicinal product bleomycin .
the clinical significance of this finding is unclear .
in another study with somatropin , no increase in chromosomal abnormalities was found in the lymphocytes of patients who had received long-term somatropin therapy .

further information
what OMNITROPE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Omnitrope is a human growth hormone which is made by a method known as recombinant DNA technology using the bacterial microorganism E. coli .
the structure is identical to the human body s own growth hormone .
Omnitrope 1.3 mg / ml is for single use only .
Omnitrope is used for
treatment of infants , children , and adolescents :
- with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone ( GH ) .
- with growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome .
- with growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency ( CRI ) .
- with growth disturbance in short children / adolescents born small for gestational age ( SGA ) ,
who failed to show catch-up growth by 4 years of age or later .
diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing . replacement of growth hormone in adults with confirmed pronounced growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) originating in either childhood or adulthood .
before YOU USE OMNITROPE
diagnosis and therapy with Omnitrope should be initiated and monitored by doctors who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders .
do not use Omnitrope
- If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of
Omnitrope .
anti-tumour therapy must be completed before
starting therapy .
- To stimulate growth if growing is already finished ( closed epiphyses ) .
- During acute life-threatening illness due to complications following open-heart surgery ,
abdominal surgery , multiple trauma caused by an accident , acute respiratory failure , or similar conditions .
take special care with Omnitrope
- Somatropin may interfere with your body &apos;s use of insulin .
your blood glucose values will have
to be checked regularly during therapy with somatropin .
insulin therapy may need
to be adjusted or started after somatropin therapy is initiated .
- Hypothyroidism ( decrease in thyroid gland function ) may develop during therapy with
somatropin .
hypothyroidism may reduce the optimal response to somatropin .
therefore , thyroid hormone levels must be checked periodically during therapy .
- Benign intracranial hypertension ( high pressure within the brain ) has been reported during
treatment with somatropin .
if symptoms , such as recurrent headache , visual problems , nausea , or vomiting occur , please ask your doctor for advice .
your doctor may decide to perform an examination of the eyes to detect increased brain pressure .
depending on the results of this test , treatment with Omnitrope may have to be interrupted .
- Patients with endocrine ( hormonal ) disorders are more likely to have problems with their hips .
if you develop a limp or pain in the hip , please ask your doctor for advice .
- Progression of scoliosis ( a spine curved sideways ) can occur in patients who experience rapid
growth .
therefore , signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment with somatropin .
however , somatropin treatment has not been shown to increase the frequency of occurrence or the severity of scoliosis .
you will have to be examined regularly for
recurrence of the malignancy .
- There is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in
patients with acute critical illness .
if acute critical illness occurs , your doctor will have to carefully evaluate the safety of continuing somatropin treatment .
- Experience in patients above 60 years of age is limited .
patients with chronic renal insufficiency ( CRI )
- In patients with CRI , somatropin therapy should not be started unless the function of the kidney
is below 50 percent of normal .
to verify growth disturbance , growth should be followed for one year before starting therapy .
conservative treatment for CRI should be continued during treatment with somatropin .
after kidney transplantation , treatment with somatropin should be stopped .
patients with Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS )
- In patients with PWS , treatment with somatropin should always be combined with a calorie-
restricted diet .
- Experience with prolonged treatment in patients with PWS is limited .
- There have been reports of deaths associated with the use of growth hormone in patients with
PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors : severe obesity , history of severe breathing problems , especially during sleep , or infection of the lungs or airways .
patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk .
before starting on Omnitrope , you should be checked for breathing problems and respiratory infections by a doctor , even if you have not been experiencing any symptoms of breathing difficulty .
- If any infection of your lungs or airways is found , you must be treated sufficiently before
starting treatment with somatropin .
you should be monitored for signs of infection while being treated with somatropin .
- Difficulty breathing while asleep , called sleep apnoea , should be examined by a specialist .
before initiation of growth hormone therapy , you should be observed for breathing problems during the night using a special monitor .
if any problems are found , then you should continue to be monitored during sleep .
- If during treatment with somatropin you show signs of breathing problems ( onset or increase of
snoring ) , treatment should be interrupted and the cause should be examined by a doctor .
- All patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during treatment with
patients born SGA
- In patients born SGA , other medical reasons or treatments that could explain the growth
disturbance should be ruled out .
therefore ,
treatment should not be started near the onset of puberty .
- Experience in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome is limited .
- Some of the height gain obtained with treating short children / adolescents born SGA with
somatropin may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached .
- Blood sugar and insulin levels should be checked before the start of treatment and annually
during treatment with growth hormone .
using other medicines
- Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other
medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for diabetes , thyroid disorder or any anticonvulsants , ciclosporin or steroid hormones such as oestrogens , progesterone or corticosteroids .
a dose adjustment may be needed for these medicines .
pregnancy and breast-feeding
treatment with Omnitrope should be interrupted during pregnancy .
ask your doctor for advice before using Omnitrope if you are breast-feeding .
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
driving and using machines
no studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
important information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
how TO USE OMNITROPE
Omnitrope is intended for subcutaneous use .
this means that it is injected through a short injection needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin .
you will receive appropriate training and instruction on the proper use of Omnitrope from your doctor or other suitably qualified health professional .
for instructions on how to inject Omnitrope , see section &quot; How to inject Omnitrope &quot; below .
treatment with somatropin is a long-term treatment .
if you want to know more about what that means for you , please ask your doctor .
how much and how often to use Omnitrope
your doctor will advise you about your individualised dose of Omnitrope and treatment schedule .
usually Omnitrope is injected once a day in the evening .
please do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor .
dose adjustments may be required over time , depending on your increase in body weight and response .
61 If you use more Omnitrope than you should
acute overdose may lead initially to hypoglycaemia ( decrease in blood glucose ) and subsequently to hyperglycaemia ( increase in blood glucose ) .
if you forget to take Omnitrope
do not inject a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses .
continue with the prescribed dosage regimen .
if you forget to take Omnitrope , please ask your doctor for advice .
how to inject Omnitrope 1.3 mg / ml
the following instructions explain how to inject Omnitrope 1.3 mg / ml yourself .
please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step .
your doctor or other suitably qualified health professional will show you how to inject Omnitrope .
do not attempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements for injection .
- After reconstitution , Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin .
- Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless .
- Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy ( local reduction of fatty
tissue under the skin ) .
preparation Collect necessary items before you begin :
- a vial with Omnitrope 1.3 mg / ml powder for solution for injection .
- a vial with solvent for Omnitrope 1.3 mg / ml .

- Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial with the
reconstituted solution .
- Turn the vial and the syringe upside down in one hand .
- Be sure that the tip of the syringe is in the Omnitrope reconstituted
solution .
your other hand will be free to move the plunger .
- Pull back on the plunger slowly and withdraw just a bit more than
the dose prescribed by your doctor into the syringe .
- Hold the syringe with the needle in the vial pointing up and remove
the syringe from the vial .
- Check for air bubbles in the syringe .
if you see any bubbles , pull
the plunger slightly back ; tap the syringe gently , with the needle pointing upwards , until the bubbles disappear .
push up the plunger slowly back to the correct dose .
- Inspect the reconstituted solution visually prior to administration .
do not use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles .
you are now ready to inject the dose .
injecting Omnitrope
- Select the site of injection .
the best sites for injection are tissues
with a layer of fat between skin and muscle , such as the thigh or belly ( except the navel or waistline ) .
- Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and
that you change the places where you inject , as you have been taught .
- Before you make an injection , clean your skin well with an alcohol
wait for the area to dry .
- With one hand , pitch a fold of loose skin .
with your other hand ,
hold the syringe as you would a pencil .
insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45 to 90 .
after the needle is in , remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel .
pull back the plunger very slightly with one hand .
if blood comes into the syringe , the needle has entered a blood vessel .
do not inject into this site ; withdraw the needle and repeat this step .
inject the solution by pushing the plunger all the way down gently .
- Pull the needle straight out of the skin .
after injecting
- After injection , press the injection site with a small bandage or
sterile gauze for several seconds .
do not massage the injection site .
- The residual solution , vials , and injection materials intended for
single use must be discarded .
dispose of the syringes safely in a closed container .

further information
what OMNITROPE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Omnitrope is a human growth hormone which is made by a method known as recombinant DNA technology using the bacterial microorganism E. coli .
the structure is identical to the human body s own growth hormone .
Omnitrope is used for
treatment of infants , children , and adolescents :
- with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone ( GH ) .
- with growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome .
- with growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency ( CRI ) .
- with growth disturbance in short children / adolescents born small for gestational age ( SGA ) ,
who failed to show catch-up growth by 4 years of age or later .
diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing . replacement of growth hormone in adults with confirmed pronounced growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) originating in either childhood or adulthood .
before YOU USE OMNITROPE
diagnosis and therapy with Omnitrope should be initiated and monitored by doctors who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders .
do not use Omnitrope
- If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of
Omnitrope .
anti-tumour therapy must be completed before
starting therapy .
- To stimulate growth if growing is already finished ( closed epiphyses ) .
- During acute life-threatening illness due to complications following open-heart surgery ,
abdominal surgery , multiple trauma caused by an accident , acute respiratory failure , or similar conditions .

tissue under the skin ) .
preparation Collect necessary items before you begin :
- a vial with Omnitrope 5 mg / ml powder for solution for injection .
- a cartridge with solvent for Omnitrope 5 mg / ml .
- a transfer set for mixing and transferring the reconstituted solution
back into the cartridge ( see Instructions for Use of the pen injector ) .
- the Omnitrope Pen L , an injection device specifically developed for
use with Omnitrope 5 mg / ml reconstituted solution for injection ( not supplied in the pack ; see Instructions for Use of the transfer set and of the injection device ) .
- a pen needle for subcutaneous injection .
- 2 cleansing swabs ( not supplied in the pack ) .
wash your hands before you continue with the next steps .
reconstituting Omnitrope
- Remove the protective cap from the vial .
with a cleansing swab ,
disinfect both the rubber membrane of the vial with powder and the rubber membrane of the cartridge with solvent .
- Use the transfer set for transferring all the solvent from the
cartridge into the vial .
follow the instructions that come with the transfer set .
- Gently swirl the reconstituted vial until the content is completely
dissolved .
do not shake
- If the solution is cloudy ( and the cloudiness does not disappear
within ten minutes ) or contains particles , it should not be used .
the contents must be clear and colourless .
- Transfer all of the dissolved solution back into the cartridge using
the transfer set .
injecting Omnitrope
- Put the cartridge with the dissolved Omnitrope into the pen for
follow the Instructions for Use of the pen injector .
to setup the pen dial the dose .
- Eliminate any air bubbles .
- Select the site of injection .
the best sites for injection are tissues
with a layer of fat between skin and muscle , such as the thigh or belly ( except the navel or waistline ) .
- Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and
that you change the places where you inject , as you have been taught .
- Before you make an injection , clean your skin well with an alcohol
wait for the area to dry .
- Insert the needle into the skin in the way your doctor has taught
you .
after injecting
- After injection , press the injection site with a small bandage or
sterile gauze for several seconds .
do not massage the injection site .
- Take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap , and discard
the needle .
this will keep the Omnitrope solution sterile and prevent leaking .

further information
what OMNITROPE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Omnitrope is a human growth hormone which is made by a method known as recombinant DNA technology using the bacterial microorganism E. coli .
the structure is identical to the human body s own growth hormone .
Omnitrope is used for
treatment of infants , children , and adolescents :
- with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone ( GH ) .
- with growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome .
- with growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency ( CRI ) .
- with growth disturbance in short children / adolescents born small for gestational age ( SGA ) ,
who failed to show catch-up growth by 4 years of age or later .
diagnosis of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing . replacement of growth hormone in adults with confirmed pronounced growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) originating in either childhood or adulthood .
before YOU USE OMNITROPE
diagnosis and therapy with Omnitrope should be initiated and monitored by doctors who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth disorders .
do not use Omnitrope
- If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to somatropin or to any of the other ingredients of
Omnitrope .
anti-tumour therapy must be completed before
starting therapy .
- To stimulate growth if growing is already finished ( closed epiphyses ) .
- During acute life-threatening illness due to complications following open-heart surgery ,
abdominal surgery , multiple trauma caused by an accident , acute respiratory failure , or similar conditions .
take special care with Omnitrope
- Somatropin may interfere with your body &apos;s use of insulin .
your blood glucose values will have
to be checked regularly during therapy with somatropin .
insulin therapy may need
to be adjusted or started after somatropin therapy is initiated .
- Hypothyroidism ( decrease in thyroid gland function ) may develop during therapy with
somatropin .
hypothyroidism may reduce the optimal response to somatropin .
therefore , thyroid hormone levels must be checked periodically during therapy .
- Benign intracranial hypertension ( high pressure within the brain ) has been reported during
treatment with somatropin .
if symptoms , such as recurrent headache , visual problems , nausea , or vomiting occur , please ask your doctor for advice .
your doctor may decide to perform an examination of the eyes to detect increased brain pressure .
depending on the results of this test , treatment with Omnitrope may have to be interrupted .
- Patients with endocrine ( hormonal ) disorders are more likely to have problems with their hips .
if you develop a limp or pain in the hip , please ask your doctor for advice .
- Progression of scoliosis ( a spine curved sideways ) can occur in patients who experience rapid
growth .
therefore , signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment with somatropin .
however , somatropin treatment has not been shown to increase the frequency of occurrence or the severity of scoliosis .
you will have to be examined regularly for
recurrence of the malignancy .
- There is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy in
patients with acute critical illness .
if acute critical illness occurs , your doctor will have to carefully evaluate the safety of continuing somatropin treatment .
- Experience in patients above 60 years of age is limited .
patients with chronic renal insufficiency ( CRI )
- In patients with CRI , somatropin therapy should not be started unless the function of the kidney
is below 50 percent of normal .
to verify growth disturbance , growth should be followed for one year before starting therapy .
conservative treatment for CRI should be continued during treatment with somatropin .
after kidney transplantation , treatment with somatropin should be stopped .
patients with Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS )
- In patients with PWS , treatment with somatropin should always be combined with a calorie-
restricted diet .
- Experience with prolonged treatment in patients with PWS is limited .
- There have been reports of deaths associated with the use of growth hormone in patients with
PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors : severe obesity , history of severe breathing problems , especially during sleep , or infection of the lungs or airways .
patients with PWS and one or more of these risk factors may be at greater risk .
before starting on Omnitrope , you should be checked for breathing problems and respiratory infections by a doctor , even if you have not been experiencing any symptoms of breathing difficulty .
- If any infection of your lungs or airways is found , you must be treated sufficiently before
starting treatment with somatropin .
you should be monitored for signs of infection while being treated with somatropin .
- Difficulty breathing while asleep , called sleep apnoea , should be examined by a specialist .
before initiation of growth hormone therapy , you should be observed for breathing problems during the night using a special monitor .
if any problems are found , then you should continue to be monitored during sleep .
- If during treatment with somatropin you show signs of breathing problems ( onset or increase of
snoring ) , treatment should be interrupted and the cause should be examined by a doctor .
- All patients with PWS should have effective weight control before and during treatment with
somatropin .
patients born SGA
- In patients born SGA , other medical reasons or treatments that could explain the growth
disturbance should be ruled out .
therefore ,
treatment should not be started near the onset of puberty .
- Experience in patients with Silver-Russell syndrome is limited .
- Some of the height gain obtained with treating short children / adolescents born SGA with
somatropin may be lost if treatment is stopped before final height is reached .
- Blood sugar and insulin levels should be checked before the start of treatment and annually
during treatment with growth hormone .
using other medicines
- Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other
medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any medicine for diabetes , thyroid disorder or any anticonvulsants , ciclosporin or steroid hormones such as oestrogens , progesterone or corticosteroids .
a dose adjustment may be needed for these medicines .
pregnancy and breast-feeding
treatment with Omnitrope should be interrupted during pregnancy .
ask your doctor for advice before using Omnitrope if you are breast-feeding .
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
driving and using machines
no studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
important information about some of the ingredients of Omnitrope

one ml contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol .
because of the presence of benzyl alcohol the medicinal product must not be given to premature babies or neonates .
may cause toxic reactions and allergic reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old .
how TO USE OMNITROPE
Omnitrope 3.3 mg / ml is intended for multiple use .
it should only be administered with the Omnitrope Pen 5 , an injection device specifically developed for use with Omnitrope 3.3 mg / ml solution for injection .
Omnitrope is given through a short injection needle into the fatty tissue just under your skin .
you will receive appropriate training and instruction on the proper use of Omnitrope from your doctor or other suitably qualified health professional .
for instructions on how to inject Omnitrope , see section &quot; How to inject Omnitrope &quot; below .
treatment with somatropin is a long-term treatment .
if you want to know more about what that means for you , please ask your doctor .
81 How much and how often to use Omnitrope
your doctor will advise you about your individualised dose of Omnitrope and treatment schedule .
usually Omnitrope is injected once a day in the evening .
please do not change the dosage and treatment schedule without consulting your doctor .
dose adjustments may be required over time , depending on your increase in body weight and response .
if you use more Omnitrope than you should
acute overdose may lead initially to hypoglycaemia ( decrease in blood glucose ) and subsequently to hyperglycaemia ( increase in blood glucose ) .
long-term overdosage could result in signs and symptoms of gigantism or acromegaly ( enhanced growth of ears , nose , lips , tongue , and cheekbones ) .
if you have used more Omnitrope than you should , please ask your doctor for advice .
if you forget to take Omnitrope
do not inject a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses .
continue with the prescribed dosage regimen .
if you forget to take Omnitrope , please ask your doctor for advice .

the following instructions explain how to inject Omnitrope 3.3 mg / ml yourself .
please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step .
your doctor or other suitably qualified health professional will show you how to inject Omnitrope .
do not attempt to inject unless you are sure you understand the procedure and requirements for injection .
- Omnitrope is given as an injection under the skin .
- Carefully inspect the solution before injecting it and use only if clear and colourless .
- Change the injection sites to minimise the risk of local lipoatrophy ( local reduction of fatty
tissue under the skin ) .
preparation Collect necessary items before you begin :
- a cartridge with Omnitrope 3.3 mg / ml solution for injection .
- the Omnitrope Pen 5 , an injection device specifically developed for
use with Omnitrope 3.3 mg / ml solution for injection ( not supplied in the pack ; see Instructions for Use provided with the Omnitrope Pen 5 ) .
- a pen needle for subcutaneous injection .
- 2 cleansing swabs ( not supplied in the pack ) .
wash your hands before you continue with the next steps .
injecting Omnitrope
- With a cleansing swab , disinfect the rubber membrane of the
cartridge .
- The contents must be clear and colourless .
- Insert the cartridge into the pen for injection .
follow the
instructions for Use of the pen injector .
to setup the pen dial the dose .
- Select the site of injection .
the best sites for injection are tissues
with a layer of fat between skin and muscle , such as the thigh or belly ( except the navel or waistline ) .
- Make sure you inject at least 1 cm from your last injection site and
that you change the places where you inject , as you have been taught .
- Before you make an injection , clean your skin well with an alcohol
wait for the area to dry .
- Insert the needle into the skin in the way your doctor has taught
you .

do not share your pen .
- Leave the cartridge in the pen , put the cap on the pen , and store it
in the refrigerator .
not use if the solution is cloudy or contains particles .
if you stop using Omnitrope
a disruption or early ending of treatment with somatropin may impair the success of growth hormone therapy .
please ask your doctor for advice before stopping treatment .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Omnitrope can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
please ask your doctor for advice when you experience any of the symptoms described below .
in adults : mild oedema
musculoskeletal system , connective tissues , bones
in adults : stiffness of the limbs , joint and muscle pain
in infants / children / adolescents : stiffness of the limbs , joint and muscle pain
in adults : sensory disturbances
benign intracranial hypertension

diabetes mellitus
disorders of the immune system Benign and malignant neoplasms
development of antibodies
leukemia
general disorders and reactions at the injection site
- Temporary local reactions at the injection site , such as pain , numbness , reddening , and swelling
are common side effects .
in isolated cases , subcutaneous administration of somatropin can lead to loss of fatty tissue at the injection site .
- Mild oedema ( accumulation of water in the tissues ) has been observed .
this side effect is a
consequence of disturbances in fluid balance and occurs only at the start of treatment with somatropin and is dose-dependent .
it is common in adult patients , but uncommon in infants , children and adolescents .
musculoskeletal system , connective tissues , and bones
- Joint and muscle pain ( especially in the hip or knee ) and stiffness of the limbs have been
observed .
these side effects occur only at the start of treatment with somatropin and are dose- dependent .
they are common in adult patients , but uncommon in infants , children and adolescents .
nervous system
- Sensory disturbances , such as numbness and tingling , have been observed .
these usually occur
at the start of treatment with somatropin and are dose-dependent .
they are common in adult patients , but uncommon in infants , children and adolescents .
- Muscular atrophy ( reduction of muscular tissue ) of the ball of the thumb and sensory
disturbances in the fingers and palm of the hand are uncommon side effects .
they are consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome ( constriction of the nerve supplying part of the palm of the hand ) , which has been observed mainly in adults .
- Visual disturbances , headaches , nausea , and vomiting have been observed .
these symptoms
could indicate benign intracranial hypertension ( increased brain pressure ) , which is a rare side effect of treatment with somatropin .
endocrine disorders
- Diabetes has been observed as a rare side effect .
disorders of the immune system
- As with all protein based medicines , some patients may develop antibodies to the protein .
however , these have not been found to have growth-inhibiting effects .
this is a common side effect .
benign and malignant neoplasms
- Very rare cases of leukemia have been reported in growth-hormone deficient children treated
with somatropin .
a causal relationship to somatropin therapy is unlikely .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

what is Onsenal ?
Onsenal is a medicine that contains the active substance celecoxib .
it is available as white capsules ( 200 and 400 mg ) .
what is Onsenal used for ?
Onsenal is used to reduce the number of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) .
this is a genetic disease that causes adenomatous intestinal polyps , growths that project from the lining of the large intestine or rectum .
because the number of patients with FAP is low , the disease is considered rare , and Onsenal was designated an orphan medicine &apos; ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) on 20 November 2001 .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Onsenal used ?
the recommended dose of Onsenal is 400 mg twice a day with food .
the usual medical care for FAP patients should be continued .
in patients with moderate liver disease , the dose of Onsenal should be halved , and it should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate kidney problems .
Onsenal must not be given to patients with severe liver or kidney problems .
it should be used with caution , possibly with a lower starting dose , in patients whose bodies may break Onsenal down slowly .
special care should be taken when it is used in the elderly .
the maximum recommended daily dose of Onsenal is 800 mg .
how does Onsenal work ?
the active substance in Onsenal , celecoxib , is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug &apos; ( NSAID ) that belongs to the group cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors .
it blocks the COX-2 enzyme , resulting in a reduction in the production of prostaglandins , substances that are involved in processes such as inflammation and the activity of smooth muscle ( muscle that performs automatic tasks such as the opening and closing of blood vessels ) .
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged .
how has Onsenal been studied ?
Onsenal has been studied in one main study involving 83 adults with FAP , in which the effectiveness of two doses of Onsenal was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
in the study , 25 patients had an intact colon ( lower gut ) , but the remainder had had some or all of their colon removed through surgery .
the main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of polyps in a defined area of the colon or rectum wall after six months of treatment .
an additional study looked at the effects of Onsenal in 18 children with FAP .
what benefit has Onsenal shown during the studies ?
Onsenal at a dose of 400 mg twice a day was more effective than placebo .
in adults , Onsenal had reduced the average number of polyps by 28 after six months , while the number fell by 5 in the patients taking placebo .
Onsenal also reduced the number of polyps in children with FAP .
what is the risk associated with Onsenal ?
the most common side effects with Onsenal ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and diarrhoea .
for the full list of all side effects reported with Onsenal , see the Package Leaflet .
Onsenal should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to celecoxib , to any of the other ingredients , or to sulphonamides ( such as some antibiotics ) .
Onsenal must not be given to pregnant women or women who could become pregnant unless they are using an effective method of contraception , or to women who are breast-feeding .
it must not be given to patients with severe liver or kidney disease , patients with a disease causing inflammation of the bowel , or patients with certain problems affecting the heart or blood vessels .
for the full list of restrictions , see the Package Leaflet .
why has Onsenal been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Onsenal &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for the reduction of the number of adenomatous intestinal polyps in FAP as an adjunct to surgery and further endoscopic surveillance .
the Committee noted that no effect of the reduced number of polyps caused by Onsenal on the risk of developing cancer of the intestine had been shown .
the Committee recommended that Onsenal be given marketing authorisation .
Onsenal has been authorised under Exceptional Circumstances .
this means that because the disease is rare , it has not been possible to obtain complete information about Onsenal .
every year , the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary .
what information is still awaited for Onsenal ?
the company that makes Onsenal will carry out a study in patients with FAP , in order to collect more information on the medicine &apos; s safety and effectiveness .
other information about Onsenal :
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Onsenal on 17 October 2003 .
the marketing authorisation holder is Pfizer Limited .
the marketing authorisation was renewed on 17 October 2008 .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction of the number of adenomatous intestinal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , as an adjunct to surgery and further endoscopic surveillance ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of Onsenal-induced reduction of polyp burden on the risk of intestinal cancer has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 and 5.1 )
posology and method of administration
the recommended oral dose is two 200 mg capsules twice per day , taken with food ( see section 5.2 ) .
usual medical care for FAP patients should be continued while on celecoxib .
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg .
hepatic impairment :
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( serum albumin of 25-35 g / l ) , the daily recommended dose of celecoxib should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 ) .
caution should be used as there is no experience in such patients at doses higher than 200 mg .
renal impairment :
experience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , therefore such patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
paediatric patients :
CYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers :
patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers based on genotyping or previous history / experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should be administered celecoxib with caution , as the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects is increased .
consider starting treatment at a reduced dose ( see section 5.2 ) .
elderly :
the dose for elderly FAP patients has not been established .
special care should be used in such patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
4.3 Contraindications
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
treatment with celecoxib in FAP has been studied for up to 6 months and has not been shown to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal or other form of cancer or the need for surgery .
therefore , the usual care of FAP patients should not be altered because of the concurrent administration of celecoxib .
in particular , the frequency of routine endoscopic surveillance should not be decreased and FAP-related surgery should not be delayed .
gastro-intestinal disorder Upper gastrointestinal complications &#91; perforations , ulcers or bleeds ( PUBs ) &#93; , some of them resulting in fatal outcome , have occurred in patients treated with celecoxib .
there is further increase in the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects ( gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when celecoxib is taken concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) .
FAP patients carrying an ileorectal anastomosis or ileo pouch-anal anastomosis can develop anastomotic ulcerations .
if an anastomotic ulcer is present , patients should not receive concomitant treatment with anticoagulants or acetyl salicylic acid .
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking ) should only be treated with celecoxib after careful consideration ( see section 5.1 ) .
3 COX-2 selective inhibitors are not a substitute for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular thrombo-embolic diseases because of their lack of antiplatelet effect .
therefore , antiplatelet therapies should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 ) .
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients taking celecoxib .
caution is also required in patients taking diuretic treatment or otherwise at risk of hypovolaemia .
as with all NSAIDS , celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension , either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events .
therefore , blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with celecoxib and throughout the course of therapy .
in the event of elderly patients with mild to moderate cardiac dysfunction requiring therapy , special care and follow up is warranted .
compromised renal or hepatic function and especially cardiac dysfunction are more likely in the elderly and therefore medically appropriate supervision should be maintained .
renal and hepatic disorders NSAIDs , including celecoxib , may cause renal toxicity .
clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs .
patients at greatest risk for renal toxicity are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , liver dysfunction , and the elderly .
such patients should be carefully monitored while receiving treatment with celecoxib .
experience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal or hepatic impairment is limited , therefore such patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
if during treatment , patients deteriorate in any of the organ system functions described above , appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of celecoxib therapy should be considered .
patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the course of therapy ; the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment .
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving celecoxib ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients with a history of sulphonamide allergy or any drug allergy may be at greater risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 ) .
celecoxib should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash , mucosal lesions , or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
other Patients known to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) .
celecoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation .
in patients on concurrent therapy with warfarin , serious bleeding events have been reported .
caution should be exercised when combining celecoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 ) .
Onsenal 200 mg capsules contain lactose ( 49.8 mg ) .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
4 The majority of the interaction studies have been performed with celecoxib doses of 200 mg BID ( i. e. those used for osteoarthritis / rheumatoid arthritis ) .
a more pronounced effect at 400 mg BID therefore cannot be excluded .
anticoagulant activity should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing the dose of celecoxib , since these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications .
therefore , patients receiving oral anticoagulants should be closely monitored for their prothrombin time INR .
NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and antihypertensive medicinal products .
therefore , the combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly .
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , and periodically thereafter .
co-administration of NSAIDs and ciclosporin D derivatives or tacrolimus have been suggested to increase the nephrotoxic effect of cyclosporin and tacrolimus .
renal function should be monitored when celecoxib and any of these medicinal products are combined .
celecoxib can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , however it cannot be considered a substitute for acetylsalicylic acid for cardiovascular prophylaxis .
as with other NSAIDs , an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications compared to use of celecoxib alone was shown for concomitant administration of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmacokinetic interactions
effects of celecoxib on other medicinal products Celecoxib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
during celecoxib treatment , the mean plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan were increased by 136 .
the plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of this enzyme may be increased when celecoxib is used concomitantly .
examples of medicines which are metabolised by CYP2D6 are antidepressants ( tricyclics and SSRIs ) , neuroleptics , anti-arrhythmics , etc .
the dose of individually dose-titrated CYP2D6 substrates may need to be reduced when treatment with celecoxib is initiated or increased if treatment with celecoxib is terminated .
in vitro studies have shown some potential for celecoxib to inhibit CYP2C19 catalysed metabolism .
the clinical significance of this in vitro finding is unknown .
examples of medicinal products which are metabolised by CYP2C19 are diazepam , citalopram and imipramine .
in an interaction study , celecoxib had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg norethistherone / 35 microg ethinylestradiol ) .
celecoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( CYP2C9 substrate ) , or glibenclamide to a clinically relevant extent .
5 In patients with rheumatoid arthritis celecoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics ( plasma or renal clearance ) of methotrexate ( in rheumatologic doses ) .
however , adequate monitoring for methotrexate-related toxicity should be considered when combining these two drugs .
in healthy subjects , co-administration of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily with 450 mg twice daily of lithium resulted in a mean increase in Cmax of 16 and in AUC of 18 of lithium .
therefore , patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or withdrawn .
effects of other medicinal products on celecoxib
in individuals who are CYP2C9 poor metabolisers and demonstrate increased systemic exposure to celecoxib , concomitant treatment with CYP2C9 inhibitors could result in further increases in celecoxib exposure .
such combinations should be avoided in known CYP2C9 poor metabolisers ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
since celecoxib is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 it should be used at half the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole .
concomitant use of 200 mg single dose of celecoxib and 200 mg once daily of fluconazole , a potent CYP2C9 inhibitor , resulted in a mean increase in celecoxib Cmax of 60 and in AUC of 130 .
concomitant use of inducers of CYP2C9 such as rifampicin , carbamazepine and barbiturates may reduce plasma concentrations of celecoxib .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
for celecoxib no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available ..
studies in animals ( rats and rabbits ) have shown reproductive toxicity ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ) .
the potential risk for humans is unknown .
celecoxib , as with other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , may cause uterine inertia and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus during the last trimester .
celecoxib is contraindicated in pregnancy and in women who can become pregnant unless using an effective method of contraception ( see section 4.3 ) .
if a woman becomes pregnant during treatment , celecoxib should be discontinued .
celecoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma .
administration of celecoxib to a limited number of lactating women has shown a very low transfer of celecoxib into breast milk .
women who take celecoxib should not breastfeed .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence while taking celecoxib should refrain from driving or operating machinery .
4.8 Undesirable effects
adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and ranked by frequency in Table 1 , reflecting data from the following sources :
- Adverse reactions reported in osteoarthritis patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients at incidence rates
in additional studies using non-selective NSAID comparators , approximately 7400 arthritis patients have been treated with celecoxib at daily doses up to 800 mg , including approximately 2300 patients treated for 1 year or longer .
the adverse reactions observed with celecoxib in these additional studies were consistent with those for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients listed in Table 1 .
- Adverse drug reactions from post-marketing surveillance as spontaneously reported during a period in
which an estimated &gt; 70 million patients were treated with celecoxib ( various doses , durations , and
because not all adverse drug reactions are reported to the MAH and included in the safety database , the frequencies of these reactions cannot be reliably determined .

overdose
there is no clinical experience of overdose in clinical trials .
single doses up to 1200 mg and multiple doses up to 1200 mg twice daily have been administered to healthy subjects for nine days without clinically significant adverse events .
in the event of suspected overdose , appropriate supportive medical care should be provided e. g. by eliminating the gastric contents , clinical supervision and , if necessary , the institution of symptomatic treatment .
dialysis is unlikely to be an efficient method of medicinal product removal due to high protein binding .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
antineoplastic , ATC code :
celecoxib is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole , chemically similar to other non-arylamine sulfonamides ( e. g. thiazides , furosemide ) but differing from arylamine sulfonamides ( e. g. sulfamethoxizole and other sulfonamide antibiotics ) .
9 Celecoxib is an oral , selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor .
no statistically significant inhibition of COX-1 ( assessed as ex vivo inhibition of thromboxane B2 &#91; TxB2 &#93; formation ) was observed in healthy volunteers at the FAP therapeutic dose of 400 mg BID .
cyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins .
two isoforms , COX-1 and COX-2 , have been identified .
COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain , inflammation and fever .
elevated levels of COX-2 are found in many pre-malignant lesions ( such as adenomatous colorectal polyps ) and epithelial cancers .
familial Adenomatous Polyposis ( FAP ) is a genetic disease resulting from an autosomal dominant genetic alteration of a tumor suppressor gene , the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene .
polyps with the APC mutation overexpress COX-2 and left untreated , these polyps continue to form and enlarge in the colon or rectum resulting in essentially a 100 chance of developing colorectal cancer .
COX-2 is also involved in ovulation , implantation and closure of the ductus arteriosus , regulation of renal function , and central nervous system functions ( fever induction , pain perception and cognitive function ) .
it may also play a role in ulcer healing .
COX-2 has been identified in tissue around gastric ulcers in man but its relevance to ulcer healing has not been established .
the difference in antiplatelet activity between some COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors may be of clinical significance in patients at risk of thrombo-embolic reactions .
COX-2 inhibitors reduce the formation of systemic ( and therefore possibly endothelial ) prostacyclin without affecting platelet thromboxane .
a dose-dependent effect on TxB2 formation has been observed after high doses of celecoxib .
however , in small multiple dose studies in healthy subjects with 600 mg BID celecoxib had no effect on platelet aggregation and bleeding time compared to placebo .
inhibition of COX-2 may have consequences on tumour viability that are unrelated to inflammation .
celecoxib inhibits tumour formation in preclinical models of colon cancer , which overexpress COX-2 , whether induced by chemical ( rat AOM model ) or genetic ( MIN mouse model ) mutation .
celecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of adenomatous colorectal polyps .
a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study was conducted in 83 patients with FAP .
the study population included 58 patients with a prior subtotal or total colectomy and 25 patients with an intact colon .
thirteen patients had the attenuated FAP phenotype .
a meaningful reduction in duodenal adenoma area was also observed compared with placebo ( 14.5 celecoxib 400 mg BID versus 1.4 placebo ) , which however was not statistically significant .
results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in polyp burden in all celecoxib treatment groups compared to the corresponding placebo treatment groups .
the greatest reduction was observed in patients treated with celecoxib 16 mg / kg / day , which corresponds to the recommended adult FAP dose of 800 mg daily .
safety data were reviewed in detail by a Data Safety Monitoring Committee , which concluded that celecoxib 16 mg / kg / day was a safe dose to recommend for further studies in juvenile FAP patients .
10 Cardiovascular Safety Long-Term Studies Involving Subjects With Sporadic Adenomatous Polyps :
two studies involving subjects with sporadic adenomatous polyps were conducted with celecoxib i. e . , the APC trial ( Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib ) and the PreSAP trial ( Prevention of Spontaneous Adenomatous Polyps ) .
in theAPC trial , there was a dose-related increase in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , or stroke ( adjudicated ) with celecoxib compared to placebo over 3 years of treatment .
the PreSAP trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant increased risk for the same composite endpoint .
cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3.0 ( 20 / 671 subjects ) and 2.5 ( 17 / 685 subjects ) , respectively , compared to 0.9 ( 6 / 679 subjects ) for placebo .
the increases for both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction .
in the PreSAP trial , the relative risk compared to placebo for this same composite endpoint ( adjudicated ) was 1.2 ( 95 CI 0.6 - 2.4 ) with celecoxib 400 mg once daily compared to placebo .
cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 2.3 ( 21 / 933 subjects ) and 1.9 ( 12 / 628 subjects ) , respectively .
the incidence of myocardial infarction ( adjudicated ) was 1.0 with ( 9 / 933 subjects ) with celecoxib 400 mg once daily and 0.6 ( 4 / 628 subjects ) with placebo .
data from a third long-term study , ADAPT ( The Alzheimer &apos;s Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial ) , did not show a significantly increased cardiovascular risk with celecoxib 200mg BID compared to placebo .
the relative risk compared to placebo for a similar composite endpoint ( CV death , MI , stroke ) was 1.14 ( 95 CI 0.61 - 2.12 ) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily .
the incidence of myocardial infarction was 1.1 ( 8 / 717 patients ) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily and 1.2 ( 13 / 1070 patients ) with placebo .
data from pooled analysis of controlled randomized trials also suggest that cardiovascular risk may be associated with the use of celecoxib compared to placebo , with evidence for differences in risk based on celecoxib dose .
this medicinal product has been authorised under &quot; Exceptional Circumstances &quot; .
this means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product .
the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
celecoxib is well absorbed reaching peak plasma concentrations after approximately 2-3 hours .
dosing with food ( high fat meal ) delays absorption by about 1 hour with an increase in total absorption ( AUC ) of 10 to 20 .
celecoxib is mainly eliminated by metabolism .
less than 1 of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine .
the inter-subject variability in the exposure of celecoxib is about 10-fold .
celecoxib exhibits dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics in the therapeutic dose range .
plasma protein binding is about 97 at therapeutic plasma concentrations and celecoxib is not preferentially bound to erythrocytes .
elimination half-life is 8-12 hours .
steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 5 days of treatment .
pharmacological activity resides in the parent substance .
the main metabolites found in the circulation have no detectable COX-1 or COX-2 activity .
celecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 .
three metabolites , inactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors , have been identified in human plasma i. e . , a primary alcohol , the corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate .
cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity , such as those homozygous for the CYP2C9 3 polymorphism .
in three separate single dose studies , involving a total of 5 subjects genotyped as CYP2C9 3 / 3 , single-dose AUC 0-24 increased by approximately 3-fold compared to normal metabolizers .
it is estimated that the frequency of the homozygous 3 / 3 genotype is 0.3-1.0 among different ethnic groups .
patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers based on previous history / experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should be administered celecoxib with caution ( see Section 4.2 ) .
no clinically significant differences were found in pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib between African-Americans and Caucasians .
when dosed at 200 mg per day the corresponding values in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41 and 146 respectively .
the metabolic capacity in patients with mild to moderate impairment was best correlated to their albumin values .
in FAP patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( serum albumin of 25-35 g / l ) , the daily recommended dose of celecoxib should be reduced by 50 .
patients with severe hepatic impairment ( serum albumin &lt; 25 g / l ) have not been studied and celecoxib is contraindicated in this patient group .
the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib has not been studied in patients with renal impairment but is unlikely to be markedly changed in these patients since it is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism .
there is little experience of celecoxib in renal impairment and therefore caution is advised when treating patients with renal impairment .
severe renal impairment is a contraindication to use .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
diaphragmatic hernia was also seen in a peri-post natal toxicity study in rats , which included exposure during the organogenetic period .
in the latter study , at the lowest systemic exposure where this anomaly occurred in a single animal , the estimated margin relative to the recommended daily human dose was 2 times more than the recommended daily human dose ( 800 mg ) .
in animals , exposure to celecoxib during early embryonic development resulted in pre-implantation and post-implantation losses .
these effects are expected following inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis .
celecoxib was excreted in rat milk .
in a peri-post natal study in rats , pup toxicity was observed .
in a two-year toxicity study an increase in nonadrenal thrombosis was observed in male rat at high doses .

Onsenal 400 mg hard capsules
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
each capsule contains 400 mg of celecoxib .
lactose Monohydrate 99.6 mgFor a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
white , opaque capsules with two gold bands marked 7767 and 400 .
clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction of the number of adenomatous intestinal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , as an adjunct to surgery and further endoscopic surveillance ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of Onsenal-induced reduction of polyp burden on the risk of intestinal cancer has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 and 5.1 )
posology and method of administration
the recommended oral dose is one 400 mg capsule twice per day , taken with food ( see section 5.2 ) .
usual medical care for FAP patients should be continued while on celecoxib .
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg .
hepatic impairment :
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( serum albumin of 25-35 g / l ) , the daily recommended dose of celecoxib should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 ) .
caution should be used as there is no experience in such patients at doses higher than 400 mg .
renal impairment :
experience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , therefore such patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
paediatric patients :
CYP2C9 Poor Metabolizers :
patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers based on genotyping or previous history / experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should be administered celecoxib with caution , as the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects is increased .
consider starting treatment at a reduced dose ( see section 5.2 ) .
elderly :
the dose for elderly FAP patients has not been established .
special care should be used in such patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
special warnings and precautions for use
treatment with celecoxib in FAP has been studied for up to 6 months and has not been shown to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal or other form of cancer or the need for surgery .
therefore , the usual care of FAP patients should not be altered because of the concurrent administration of celecoxib .
in particular , the frequency of routine endoscopic surveillance should not be decreased and FAP-related surgery should not be delayed .
there is further increase in the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects ( gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when celecoxib is taken concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) .
NSAIDs acetylsalicylic acid has not been demonstrated in long-term clinical trials ( see 5.1 ) .
the concomitant use of celecoxib and a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided .
FAP patients carrying an ileorectal anastomosis or ileo pouch-anal anastomosis can develop anastomotic ulcerations .
if an anastomotic ulcer is present , patients should not receive concomitant treatment with anticoagulants or acetyl salicylic acid .
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking ) should only be treated with celecoxib after careful consideration ( see section 5.1 ) .
15 COX-2 selective inhibitors are not a substitute for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular thrombo-embolic diseases because of their lack of antiplatelet effect .
therefore , antiplatelet therapies should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 ) .
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients taking celecoxib .
caution is also required in patients taking diuretic treatment or otherwise at risk of hypovolaemia .
as with all NSAIDS , celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension , either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events .
therefore , blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with celecoxib and throughout the course of therapy .
in the event of elderly patients with mild to moderate cardiac dysfunction requiring therapy , special care and follow up is warranted .
compromised renal or hepatic function and especially cardiac dysfunction are more likely in the elderly and therefore medically appropriate supervision should be maintained .
renal and hepatic disorders NSAIDs , including celecoxib , may cause renal toxicity .
clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs .
patients at greatest risk for renal toxicity are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , liver dysfunction , and the elderly .
such patients should be carefully monitored while receiving treatment with celecoxib .
experience with celecoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal or hepatic impairment is limited , therefore such patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
if during treatment , patients deteriorate in any of the organ system functions described above , appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of celecoxib therapy should be considered .
skin Reactions Serious skin reactions , some of them fatal , including exfoliative dermatitis , Stevens-Johnson syndrome , and toxic epidermal necrolysis , have been reported very rarely in association with the use of celecoxib ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients appear to be at highest risk for these reactions early in the course of therapy ; the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment .
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving celecoxib ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients with a history of sulphonamide allergy or any drug allergy may be at greater risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 ) .
celecoxib should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash , mucosal lesions , or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
other Patients known to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) .
celecoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation .
in patients on concurrent therapy with warfarin , serious bleeding events have been reported .
caution should be exercised when combining celecoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 ) .
Onsenal 400 mg capsules contain lactose ( 99.6 mg ) .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
16 The majority of the interaction studies have been performed with celecoxib doses of 200 mg BID ( i. e. those used for osteoarthritis / rheumatoid arthritis ) .
a more pronounced effect at 400 mg BID therefore cannot be excluded .
anticoagulant activity should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing the dose of celecoxib , since these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications .
therefore , patients receiving oral anticoagulants should be closely monitored for their prothrombin time INR .
NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and antihypertensive medicinal products .
therefore , the combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly .
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , and periodically thereafter .
co-administration of NSAIDs and cyclosporine D derivatives or tacrolimus have been suggested to increase the nephrotoxic effect of cyclosporin and tacrolimus .
renal function should be monitored when celecoxib and any of these medicinal products are combined .
celecoxib can be used with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , however it cannot be considered a substitute for acetylsalicylic acid for cardiovascular prophylaxis .
as with other NSAIDs , an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications compared to use of celecoxib alone was shown for concomitant administration of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmacokinetic interactions
effects of celecoxib on other medicinal products Celecoxib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
during celecoxib treatment , the mean plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan were increased by 136 .
the plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of this enzyme may be increased when celecoxib is used concomitantly .
examples of medicines which are metabolised by CYP2D6 are antidepressants ( tricyclics and SSRIs ) , neuroleptics , anti-arrhythmics , etc .
the dose of individually dose-titrated CYP2D6 substrates may need to be reduced when treatment with celecoxib is initiated or increased if treatment with celecoxib is terminated .
in vitro studies have shown some potential for celecoxib to inhibit CYP2C19 catalysed metabolism .
the clinical significance of this in vitro finding is unknown .
examples of medicinal products which are metabolised by CYP2C19 are diazepam , citalopram and imipramine .
in an interaction study , celecoxib had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg norethistherone / 35 microg ethinylestradiol ) .
celecoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( CYP2C9 substrate ) , or glibenclamide to a clinically relevant extent .
17 In patients with rheumatoid arthritis celecoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics ( plasma or renal clearance ) of methotrexate ( in rheumatologic doses ) .
however , adequate monitoring for methotrexate-related toxicity should be considered when combining these two drugs .
in healthy subjects , co-administration of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily with 450 mg twice daily of lithium resulted in a mean increase in Cmax of 16 and in AUC of 18 of lithium .
therefore , patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or withdrawn .
effects of other medicinal products on celecoxib
in individuals who are CYP2C9 poor metabolisers and demonstrate increased systemic exposure to celecoxib , concomitant treatment with CYP2C9 inhibitors could result in further increases in celecoxib exposure .
such combinations should be avoided in known CYP2C9 poor metabolisers ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
since celecoxib is predominantly metabolised by CYP2C9 it should be used at half the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole .
concomitant use of 200 mg single dose of celecoxib and 200 mg once daily of fluconazole , a potent CYP2C9 inhibitor , resulted in a mean increase in celecoxib Cmax of 60 and in AUC of 130 .
concomitant use of inducers of CYP2C9 such as rifampicin , carbamazepine and barbiturates may reduce plasma concentrations of celecoxib .
pregnancy and lactation
for celecoxib no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available ..
studies in animals ( rats and rabbits ) have shown reproductive toxicity ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ) .
the potential risk for humans is unknown .
celecoxib , as with other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , may cause uterine inertia and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus during the last trimester .
celecoxib is contraindicated in pregnancy and in women who can become pregnant unless using an effective method of contraception ( see section 4.3 ) .
if a woman becomes pregnant during treatment , celecoxib should be discontinued .
celecoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma .
administration of celecoxib to a limited number of lactating women has shown a very low transfer of celecoxib into breast milk .
women who take celecoxib should not breastfeed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence while taking celecoxib should refrain from driving or operating machinery .
4.8 Undesirable effects Adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and ranked by frequency in Table 1 , reflecting data from the following sources :
- Adverse reactions reported in osteoarthritis patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients at incidence rates
in additional studies using non-selective NSAID comparators , approximately 7400 arthritis patients have been treated with celecoxib at daily doses up to 800 mg , including approximately 2300 patients treated for 1 year or longer .
- Adverse drug reactions from post-marketing surveillance as spontaneously reported during a period in
which an estimated &gt; 70 million patients were treated with celecoxib ( various doses , durations , and indications ) .
because not all adverse drug reactions are reported to the MAH and included in the safety database , the frequencies of these reactions cannot be reliably determined .
