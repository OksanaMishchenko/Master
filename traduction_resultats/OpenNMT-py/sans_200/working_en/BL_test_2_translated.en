L10F : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as a single agent or 10 mg per day ( see section 5.1 ) .
recurrence prevention of Life :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
in patients receiving entacapone during the allergen episode of recurrence , treatment should be continued at the same dose .
in the clinical pharmacology of the signs , treatment of depressive symptoms should be implemented .
in all indications , the daily dose of L-dopa may be adjusted based on clinical judgement of 5 to 20 mg per day .
an initial doses of greater than 24 hours is recommended for the first dose , and should generally be considered only at 24 hours at 24 hours .
Lansoprazol can be given during or without food , food intake .
patients should be advised to calculate the doses when deciding upon discontinuation of anticoagulation .
children and adolescents :
liver weights , lipid and duodenal tissue disorders were reported as a greater risk in BYETTA-treated patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated but , but should be considered for patients aged 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for these patients .
in the case of moderate hepatic impairment ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class ml or B ) , the initial dose should be increased by 5 mg and will be increased with caution .
gender The starting and dose interval adjustment would not be required in women compared to male patients .
smoking The starting dose and the dose of doses should not require smoking concentrations compared to non-smokers .
in addition you may want to reduce the dose .
however , the dose should be adjusted with caution in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance , to peanut or soya or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the increased incidence of death was not related to the
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as T-wave attack , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in these trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .
the efficacy of interferon-gamma has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients had been pre-treated to start of the study compared with its increased regimen ( dopamine dopamine ) and resume treatment with the same study , at the same time .

false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
weight gain , which may be a unique increase in body weight , has been reported .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
however , the clinical experience :
since bicarbonate is limited in patients with a condition , caution should be exercised when prescribing to seek medical advice , bile , duodenal obstruction , or any other types of infections .
liver function Cases of asymptomatic and asymptomatic transaminases were frequently observed in initiation of treatment .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
infections has been reported with concomitant use of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients with VTE experienced risk factors for VTE , with a potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as serial angiography ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
Impetiginous lesions In single-dose assays or less than one year , the occurrence of 5.25 deposition was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Febuxostat tablet contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
the film-coating contains soya lecithin .
the patients to rule or soya should not take these tablets .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
there is no significant effect of allopurinol ( CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine .
potential for intranasal medicinal products on other cutaneously can promote direct effects and indirect agonists .
antiemetics does not inhibit the major human CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 ) .
no interaction was shown when co-administering and lithium or procaine .
monitoring of fondaparinux plasma concentrations did not need to be adjusted after initiation of anticoagulation therapy .

pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
women should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking irinotecan .
effects on ability to drive and use machines

overdose
if overdose occurs , very commonly ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are tachycardia , restlessness / haemoptysis , stupor , extrapyramidal symptoms , and decreased consciousness of consciousness due to coma .
other clinically significant effects of overdose are : bromocriptine , convulsion , coma , preclinical epidermal necrolysis , supraventricular instability , supraventricular arrhythmias , cerebral arrhythmias , hypertension , or hypotension .
prospectively There have been reports of acute poisoning to a low dose as 450 mg but a 12-month gap was also reported with BOTTLE overdose .
there is no specific antidote for P-glycoprotein .
it is not recommended to cause vomiting .
the standard management of a standard overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated powdered charcoal ) .
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of 450 to 60 .
symptomatic and supportive treatment should be assessed as clinically indicated , including treatment of hypotension and collapse .
do not use the mirror , dopamine or other dressings as the stimulation of adrenergic beta cells may exacerbate progression .
close monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical and close monitoring should be removed until the patient is recovers .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code A08AB01 .
Patient-time is a antipsychotic agent , antiemetic treatment and 28.4 with a wide number of receptors on a number of receptors .
animal studies have shown that it has been shown that , dopaminergic and cholinergic systems , which taken the binding profile to receptors .
it has been shown in vitro studies that travoprost has a greater high affinity for muscarinic receptors that for dopamine D2 and a greater battery of in lifetime models of experimental models .
it has been shown in studies evaluating the rapidly-dissolving transmission of dopaminergic pups to dopamine in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic the motor system ( GCP ) by the motor system ( GCP ) .
Patient-time reduces the response of the glucocorticoid , which may indicate extreme at doses below the maximun doses , which may indicate the onset of partial adverse events .
in contrast to other antipsychotic agents , mecamylamine increases the response to which &quot; 643 &quot; .
in a peri-postnatal study of 2,192 ( 11.7 ) in healthy subjects using a single oral dose of 10-300 mg ( 10 mg ) , foscarnet a 5HT3 receptor antagonist than the receptors .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of manic symptoms , Patient-time has been shown to induce a efficacy greater than placebo and Tmax for 24 weeks .
antiemetics was also comparable results in the proportion of patients in the remission of the patients in remission to remission in remission from remission to remission in remission .
a significant difference in the PROactive group compared to placebo was observed for the primary endpoint in bipolar disorder .
antiemetics was used at supratherapeutic dose and up to 20 mg per day .
during treatment with disopyramide , adolescents had significantly greater weight than adults .
the appearance of total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol and 1.27 ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy data on the long-term safety of therapy ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
Patient-time is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations occurring within a period of 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the administered concentrate from intravenous administration has not been determined .
antiemetics is metabolized in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan ; it does not yet pass the opened barrier .
these metabolites have shown in vivo pharmacological activity only in vivo animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the pharmacological

the rate of bending on plasma proteins is approximately 0.14 of approximately 50 , for a concentration range of approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
Patient-time is primarily bound to and glucuronic acid .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials , the mean change in INR was approximately 27 in adolescents .
preliminary studies between adolescents and adults undergoing body weight less than one less frequent numbers of neutrophils in adolescents .
such factors might contribute to the observation of the highest exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
4 preceded , following oral administration in rodents are consistent with potent subtypes , coma , convulsion , stupor , and decreases in weight taking weight .
treatment-emergent doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs were tolerated at single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without reperfusion .
clinical signs was : shaking , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , wheezing , and anorexia .
single oral monkey up to 100 mg / kg was administered in F1 monkey and at doses higher than at doses higher .
in studies with up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the full unwanted effects were of CNS depression , additive effects and haematological effects .
this safety findings occurred in depression .
growth parameters were increase to high doses .

haematological toxicity :
haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including varying degrees of mitochondrial counts in mice and a decrease in the number of erythrocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation marrow defects was seen .
in cynomolgus monkeys , no adverse effects on either expression of progenitor cells or trace marrow cells were observed .
there was no teratogenic effects .
sedation was treated with the effect on the ability of male rats .
in rat foetuses receiving interferon-gamma , the gradual foetal development and a transient decrease in the level of small activity were observed .
Patient-time has no mutagenic effects or neither mutagenic effects , in a battery of standard assays , such as keeping bacterial mutation , and in vivo experiments .
based on the results of mice and rats , it was not known to be carcinogenic .

irinotecan is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
Patient-time is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes .
Patient-time is indicated in the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who had responded to the treatment with levodopa during a episode of mania ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
PI-experienced adults :
the recommended starting dose of L-dopa is 10 mg per day .
L10F : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as a single agent or 10 mg per day ( see section 5.1 ) .
recurrence prevention of Life :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
in patients receiving entacapone during the allergen episode of recurrence , treatment should be continued at the same dose .
in the clinical pharmacology of the signs , treatment of depressive symptoms should be implemented .
in all indications , the daily dose of L-dopa may be adjusted based on clinical judgement of 5 to 20 mg per day .
it can be
2 administered with or without food , food intake
patients should be advised to calculate the doses when deciding upon discontinuation of anticoagulation .
children and adolescents :
liver weights , lipid and duodenal tissue disorders were reported as a greater risk in BYETTA-treated patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated but , but should be considered for patients aged 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for these patients .
in the case of moderate hepatic impairment ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class ml or B ) , the initial dose should be increased by 5 mg and will be increased with caution .
gender The starting and dose interval adjustment would not be required in women compared to male patients .
smoking The starting dose and the dose of doses should not require smoking concentrations compared to non-smokers .
in addition you may want to reduce the dose .
however , the dose should be adjusted with caution in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
in this patient population , a age of 65 years , O-dealkylation , myositis , and dehydration , causes of interstitial pulmonary disease ( such as with or without angiography ) or concurrent use of concomitant administration of concurrent medications or concomitant use of concomitant medicinal products or concomitant use of concomitant medications .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as T-wave attack , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in these trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .
the efficacy of interferon-gamma has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients had been pre-treated to start of the study compared with its increased regimen ( dopamine dopamine ) and resume treatment with the same study , at the same time .
the starting dose of L-dopa was 2.5 mg / day and can be adjusted by the investigator until a maximum of 15 mg / day .
false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
weight gain , which may be a unique increase in body weight , has been reported .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
4 In patients with progressive hypertrophy of the septum , pancreatitis paralytic or any other treatment with the reticulo-endothelial system .
liver function Cases of asymptomatic and asymptomatic transaminases were frequently observed in initiation of treatment .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
infections has been reported with concomitant use of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients who often develop risk factors for VTE , potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as amitriptyline ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures employed .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
rare cases of rare
5 There have been reports in patients treated with interferon-gamma .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of meningomyelocele was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Febuxostat tablet contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
there is no significant effect of fluoxetine ( CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , repeated doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine , was not significantly affected by the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa .
potential for intranasal medicinal products on other cutaneously can promote direct effects and indirect agonists .
antiemetics does not inhibit the major human CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 ) .
no interaction was shown when co-administering and lithium or procaine .
monitoring of fondaparinux plasma concentrations did not need to be adjusted after initiation of anticoagulation therapy .
general disorders and nutritional systems is recommended for patients who have committed alcohol or who have undergone central nervous system of the central nervous system .
the use of ethinyl estradiol and medicinal products in patients with homozygous and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
caution should be exercised when giving the anticoagulation is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the heart rate-corrected QT ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
women should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking irinotecan .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because of the risk of somnolence and vertigo , patients should be cautioned against this risk when using machines , including driving , driving or operating machinery .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : acquired antipsychotics , dantrolene , and serological de Gaulle .
Patient-time is a antipsychotic agent , antiemetic treatment and 28.4 with a wide number of receptors on a number of receptors .
animal studies have shown that it has been shown that , dopaminergic and cholinergic systems , which taken the binding profile to receptors .
it has been shown in vitro studies that travoprost has a greater high affinity for muscarinic receptors that for dopamine D2 and a greater battery of in lifetime models of experimental models .
it has been shown in studies evaluating the rapidly-dissolving transmission of dopaminergic pups to dopamine in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic the motor system ( GCP ) by the motor system ( GCP ) .
Patient-time reduces the response of the glucocorticoid , which may indicate extreme at doses below the maximun doses , which may indicate the onset of partial adverse events .
in contrast to other antipsychotic agents , mecamylamine increases the response to which &quot; 643 &quot; .
in an ongoing PROactive study ( PET ) in healthy subjects who received a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , Patient-time was an inconsistent receptor antagonist at the
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of manic symptoms , Patient-time has been shown to induce a efficacy greater than placebo and Tmax for 24 weeks .
Patient-time also demonstrated results in comparable efficacy results to haloperidol through the manic of manic from mania and febrile to 6 weeks .
a significant difference in the PROactive group compared to placebo was observed for the primary endpoint in bipolar disorder .
antiemetics was used at supratherapeutic dose and up to 20 mg per day .
during treatment with disopyramide , adolescents had significantly greater weight than adults .
the appearance of total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol and 1.27 ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was further in adolescents
what in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy data on the long-term safety of therapy ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
Patient-time is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations occurring within a period of 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the administered concentrate from intravenous administration has not been determined .
antiemetics is metabolized in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan ; it does not yet pass the opened barrier .
these metabolites have shown in vivo pharmacological activity only in vivo animal studies .

such factors might contribute to the observation of the highest exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Patients have a potential for toxicity following oral toxicity in rodents are reversed , cytomegalovirus , coma , stupor , and decrease in weight .
treatment-emergent doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs were tolerated at single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without reperfusion .
clinical signs was : shaking , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , wheezing , and anorexia .
single oral monkey up to 100 mg / kg was administered in F1 monkey and at doses higher than at doses higher .
repeated doses of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , was depression and haematological effects .
this safety findings occurred in depression .
growth parameters were increase to high doses .
gastrointestinal effects related to intercalation in rats were enrolled by a reduction in the incidence of a mammalian- cell viability and multiplication of ROS receptor .
haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including varying degrees of mitochondrial counts in mice and a decrease in the number of erythrocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation marrow defects was seen .
in cynomolgus monkeys , no adverse effects on either expression of progenitor cells or trace marrow cells were observed .
there is no evidence of impaired fertility toxicity .
sedation was treated with the effect on the ability of male rats .
in rat foetuses receiving interferon-gamma , the gradual foetal development and a transient decrease in the level of small activity were observed .
mutagenicity Paracetamol did not show any mutagenic effects nor clastogenic , in a battery of standard assays , such as a mutation of bacterial , and in vivo experiments .

Patient-time is a antipsychotic agent , antiemetic treatment and 28.4 with a wide number of receptors on a number of receptors .
animal studies have shown that it has been shown that , dopaminergic and cholinergic systems , which taken the binding profile to receptors .
it has been shown in vitro studies that travoprost has a greater high affinity for muscarinic receptors that for dopamine D2 and a greater battery of in lifetime models of experimental models .
it has been shown in studies evaluating the rapidly-dissolving transmission of dopaminergic pups to dopamine in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic the motor system ( GCP ) by the motor system ( GCP ) .
Patient-time reduces the response of the glucocorticoid , which may indicate extreme at doses below the maximun doses , which may indicate the onset of partial adverse events .
in contrast to other antipsychotic agents , mecamylamine increases the response to which &quot; 643 &quot; .
in an ongoing PROactive study ( PET ) in healthy subjects who received a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , Patient-time was an inconsistent receptor antagonist at the
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of manic symptoms , Patient-time has been shown to induce a efficacy greater than placebo and Tmax for 24 weeks .
Patient-time also demonstrated results in comparable efficacy results to haloperidol through the manic of manic from mania and febrile to 6 weeks .
a significant difference in the PROactive group compared to placebo was observed for the primary endpoint in bipolar disorder .

Patient-time is a antipsychotic agent , antiemetic treatment and 28.4 with a wide number of receptors on a number of receptors .
animal studies have shown that it has been shown that , dopaminergic and cholinergic systems , which taken the binding profile to receptors .
it has been shown in vitro studies that travoprost has a greater high affinity for muscarinic receptors that for dopamine D2 and a greater battery of in lifetime models of experimental models .
it has been shown in studies evaluating the rapidly-dissolving transmission of dopaminergic pups to dopamine in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic the motor system ( GCP ) by the motor system ( GCP ) .
Patient-time reduces the response of the glucocorticoid , which may indicate extreme at doses below the maximun doses , which may indicate the onset of partial adverse events .
in contrast to other antipsychotic agents , mecamylamine increases the response to which &quot; 643 &quot; .
in an ongoing PROactive study ( PET ) in healthy subjects who received a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , Patient-time was an inconsistent receptor antagonist at the
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of manic symptoms , Patient-time has been shown to induce a efficacy greater than placebo and Tmax for 24 weeks .
Patient-time also demonstrated results in comparable efficacy results to haloperidol through the manic of manic from mania and febrile to 6 weeks .
a significant difference in the PROactive group compared to placebo was observed for the primary endpoint in bipolar disorder .

irinotecan is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
Patient-time is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes .
Patient-time is indicated in the prevention of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who had responded to the treatment with levodopa during a episode of mania ( see section 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
PI-experienced adults :
the recommended starting dose of L-dopa is 10 mg per day .
L10F : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as a single agent or 10 mg per day ( see section 5.1 ) .
recurrence prevention of Life :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
in patients receiving entacapone during the allergen episode of recurrence , treatment should be continued at the same dose .
in the clinical pharmacology of the signs , treatment of depressive symptoms should be implemented .
in all indications , the daily dose of L-dopa may be adjusted based on clinical judgement of 5 to 20 mg per day .
an initial doses of greater than 24 hours is recommended for the first dose , and should generally be considered only at 24 hours at 24 hours .
Lansoprazol can be given during or without food , food intake .
patients should be advised to calculate the doses when deciding upon discontinuation of anticoagulation .
children and adolescents :
liver weights , lipid and duodenal tissue disorders were reported as a greater risk in BYETTA-treated patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated but , but should be considered for patients aged 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for these patients .
in the case of moderate hepatic impairment ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class ml or B ) , the initial dose should be increased by 5 mg and will be increased with caution .
gender The starting and dose interval adjustment would not be required in women compared to male patients .
smoking The starting dose and the dose of doses should not require smoking concentrations compared to non-smokers .
in addition you may want to reduce the dose .
however , the dose should be adjusted with caution in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as T-wave attack , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in these trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .
the efficacy of interferon-gamma has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients had been pre-treated to start of the study compared with its increased regimen ( dopamine dopamine ) and resume treatment with the same study , at the same time .
the starting dose of L-dopa was 2.5 mg / day and can be adjusted by the investigator until a maximum of 15 mg / day .
false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
weight gain , which may be a unique increase in body weight , has been reported .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
therefore , minor liver function and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases were frequently observed in initiation of treatment .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
infections has been reported with concomitant use of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients who often develop risk factors for VTE , potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as amitriptyline ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures employed .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
thirteen Dyskinesia In the RESIST trials or less duration , the occurrence of osteocalcin was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Febuxostat tablet contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
with fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine was not significantly affected by the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa .

other clinically significant effects of overdose are : bromocriptine , convulsion , coma , preclinical epidermal necrolysis , supraventricular instability , supraventricular arrhythmias , cerebral arrhythmias , hypertension , or hypotension .
prospectively There have been reports of acute poisoning to a low dose as 450 mg but a 12-month gap was also reported with BOTTLE overdose .
59 Treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote for competition for olanzapine-treated patients .
it is not recommended to cause vomiting .
the standard management of a standard overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated powdered charcoal ) .
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of 450 to 60 .
symptomatic and supportive treatment should be assessed as clinically indicated , including treatment of hypotension and collapse .
do not use the mirror , dopamine or other dressings as the stimulation of adrenergic beta cells may exacerbate progression .
close monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias .
close medical and close monitoring should be removed until the patient is recovers .

( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
in this patient population , a age of 65 years , O-dealkylation , myositis , and dehydration , causes of interstitial pulmonary disease ( such as with or without angiography ) or concurrent use of concomitant administration of concurrent medications or concomitant use of concomitant medicinal products or concomitant use of concomitant medications .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as T-wave attack , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in these trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .

the starting dose of L-dopa was 2.5 mg / day and can be adjusted by the investigator until a maximum of 15 mg / day .
false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
weight gain , which may be a unique increase in body weight , has been reported .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
caution should be exercised when prescribing to patients with oesophageal hypertrophy , spontaneously hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or any other treatment with the reticulo-endothelial system .
liver function Cases of asymptomatic and asymptomatic transaminases were frequently observed in initiation of treatment .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
infections has been reported with concomitant use of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients who often develop risk factors for VTE , potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as amitriptyline ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures employed .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
rare cases of rare
convulsions have been reported in patients treated with interferon-gamma .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of meningomyelocele was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Febuxostat tablet contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
there is no significant effect of fluoxetine ( CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , repeated doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine , was not significantly affected by the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa .
potential for intranasal medicinal products on other cutaneously can promote direct effects and indirect agonists .
antiemetics does not inhibit the major human CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 ) .
no interaction was shown when co-administering and lithium or procaine .
monitoring of fondaparinux plasma concentrations did not need to be adjusted after initiation of anticoagulation therapy .

the use of ethinyl estradiol and medicinal products in patients with homozygous and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
caution should be exercised when giving the anticoagulation is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the heart rate-corrected QT ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
women should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking irinotecan .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because of the risk of somnolence and vertigo , patients should be cautioned against this risk when using machines , including driving , driving or operating machinery .

however , the dose should be adjusted with caution in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
3 Toxicity ( such as a-GVHD , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in either clinical trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .
the efficacy of interferon-gamma has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients had been pre-treated to start of the study compared with its increased regimen ( dopamine dopamine ) and resume treatment with the same study , at the same time .
the starting dose of L-dopa was 2.5 mg / day and can be adjusted by the investigator until a maximum of 15 mg / day .
false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
weight gain , which may be a unique increase in body weight , has been reported .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
this is predominantly fatal and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases were observed in initiation of treatment .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
infections has been reported with concomitant use of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients with VTE experienced risk factors for VTE , with a potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as serial angiography ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
5 Mix in pre-clinical studies of the less than or less duration , the occurrence of urate was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose 17.2 , film-coated tablets , contains lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
with fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine was not significantly affected by the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa .
potential effects of L-dopa on other medicinal products can promote the direct effects and indirect agonists .
antiemetics does not inhibit the major human CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 ) .
no interaction was shown when co-administering and lithium or procaine .
monitoring of fondaparinux plasma concentrations did not need to be adjusted after initiation of anticoagulation therapy .
general disorders and nutritional systems is recommended for patients who have committed alcohol or who have undergone central nervous system of the central nervous system .
the use of ethinyl estradiol and medicinal products in patients with homozygous and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
caution should be exercised when giving the anticoagulation is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the heart rate-corrected QT ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
women should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking irinotecan .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because of the risk of somnolence and vertigo , patients should be cautioned against this risk when using machines , including driving , driving or operating machinery .

L10F : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as a single agent or 10 mg per day ( see section 5.1 ) .
recurrence prevention of Life :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
in patients receiving entacapone during the allergen episode of recurrence , treatment should be continued at the same dose .
in the clinical pharmacology of the signs , treatment of depressive symptoms should be implemented .
in all indications , the daily dose of L-dopa may be adjusted based on clinical judgement of 5 to 20 mg per day .
an initial doses of greater than 24 hours is recommended for the first dose , and should generally be considered only at 24 hours at 24 hours .
patients should be advised to calculate the doses when deciding upon discontinuation of anticoagulation .
children and adolescents :
liver weights , lipid and duodenal tissue disorders were reported as a greater risk in BYETTA-treated patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated but , but should be considered for patients aged 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for these patients .
in the case of moderate hepatic impairment ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class ml or B ) , the initial dose should be increased by 5 mg and will be increased with caution .
gender The starting and dose interval adjustment would not be required in women compared to male patients .
smoking The starting dose and the dose of doses should not require smoking concentrations compared to non-smokers .
in addition you may want to reduce the dose .
however , the dose should be adjusted with caution in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as T-wave attack , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in these trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .
the efficacy of interferon-gamma has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients had been pre-treated to start of the study compared with its increased regimen ( dopamine dopamine ) and resume treatment with the same study , at the same time .
the starting dose of L-dopa was 2.5 mg / day and can be adjusted by the investigator until a maximum of 15 mg / day .
false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
in some cases weight gain , which may be a factor VIII-containing activity has been reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities anomalies were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
liver function Cases of asymptomatic and asymptomatic transaminases were frequently observed in initiation of treatment .
patients with hepatic impairment , including patients with compensated liver disease and patients treated with potentially selective anticoagulant agents .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
neutropenia has been reported following concomitant administration of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients with VTE experienced risk factors for VTE , with a potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as serial angiography ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of meningomyelocele was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
feeling hot Vascular disorders was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose 17.2 , film-coated tablets , contains lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
with fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine was not significantly affected by the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa .
potential for intranasal medicinal products on other cutaneously can promote direct effects and indirect agonists .
antiemetics does not inhibit the major human CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 ) .
no interaction was shown when co-administering and lithium or procaine .
monitoring of fondaparinux plasma concentrations did not need to be adjusted after initiation of anticoagulation therapy .
general disorders and nutritional systems is recommended for patients who have committed alcohol or who have undergone central nervous system of the central nervous system .
the use of ethinyl estradiol and medicinal products in patients with homozygous and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
caution should be exercised when giving the anticoagulation is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the heart rate-corrected QT ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
women should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking irinotecan .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because of the risk of somnolence and vertigo , patients should be cautioned against this risk when using machines , including driving , driving or operating machinery .

elderly patients A lower dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated but , but should be considered for patients aged 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for these patients .
in the case of moderate hepatic impairment ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class ml or B ) , the initial dose should be increased by 5 mg and will be increased with caution .
gender The starting and dose interval adjustment would not be required in women compared to male patients .
smoking The starting dose and the dose of doses should not require smoking concentrations compared to non-smokers .
in addition you may want to reduce the dose .
however , the dose should be adjusted with caution in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
adverse events
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .

weight gain , which may be a unique increase in body weight , has been reported .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
antitumour activity that has profibrinolytic activity in vitro has profibrinolytic activity in vitro clinical studies .
caution should be exercised in patients with local hepatic disease .
patients with ALT and / or AST , in patients experiencing signs and symptoms of liver damage , in patients with compensated liver function and those undergoing potentially selective anticoagulant agents .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
infections has been reported with concomitant use of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients with VTE experienced risk factors for VTE , with a potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as serial angiography ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of meningomyelocele was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
musculoskeletal
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose 17.2 , film-coated tablets , contains lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
with fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine was not significantly affected by the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa .

caution should be exercised when giving the anticoagulation is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the heart rate-corrected QT ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
women should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking irinotecan .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .

convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of meningomyelocele was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .

potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .

PI-experienced adults :
the recommended starting dose of L-dopa is 10 mg per day .
L10F : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as a single agent or 10 mg per day ( see section 5.1 ) .
recurrence prevention of Life :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
in patients receiving entacapone during the allergen episode of recurrence , treatment should be continued at the same dose .
in the clinical pharmacology of the signs , treatment of depressive symptoms should be implemented .
in all indications , the daily dose of L-dopa may be adjusted based on clinical judgement of 5 to 20 mg per day .
an initial doses of greater than 24 hours is recommended for the first dose , and should generally be considered only at 24 hours at 24 hours .
Lansoprazol can be given during or without food , food intake .
patients should be advised to calculate the doses when deciding upon discontinuation of anticoagulation .
children and adolescents :
liver weights , lipid and duodenal tissue disorders were reported as a greater risk in BYETTA-treated patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated but , but should be considered for patients aged 65 and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required for these patients .
in the case of moderate hepatic impairment ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class ml or B ) , the initial dose should be increased by 5 mg and will be increased with caution .
gender The starting and dose interval adjustment would not be required in women compared to male patients .
smoking The starting dose and the dose of doses should not require smoking concentrations compared to non-smokers .
in addition you may want to reduce the dose .
however , the dose should be adjusted with caution in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
ischaemic adverse events have been reported in the same clinical trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .
the efficacy of interferon-gamma has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients had been pre-treated to start of the study compared with its increased regimen ( dopamine dopamine ) and resume treatment with the same study , at the same time .
the starting dose of L-dopa was 2.5 mg / day and can be adjusted by the investigator until a maximum of 15 mg / day .
false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
weight gain , which may be a unique increase in body weight , has been reported .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
caution should be exercised in patients with local hepatic disease .
patients with ALT and / or AST are taking elevated ALT and / or AST , in patients with deteriorating liver function and those receiving potentially selective medicinal products .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .
infections has been reported with concomitant use of probenicid and steady-state ( see section 4.8 ) .
tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients with VTE experienced risk factors for VTE , with a potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as serial angiography ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures .
special warnings and nutrition disorders :
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of meningomyelocele was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
feeling hot Vascular disorder was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose 17.2 , film-coated tablets , contains lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
with fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine was not significantly affected by the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa .
potential for intranasal medicinal products on other cutaneously can promote direct effects and indirect agonists .
antiemetics does not inhibit the major human CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 ) .
therefore , no special interaction expected to be expected .
no interaction was shown when co-administering and lithium or procaine .
monitoring of fondaparinux plasma concentrations did not need to be adjusted after initiation of anticoagulation therapy .
general disorders and nutritional systems is recommended for patients who have committed alcohol or who have undergone central nervous system of the central nervous system .
the use of ethinyl estradiol and medicinal products in patients with homozygous and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
caution should be exercised when giving the anticoagulation is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the heart rate-corrected QT ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
women should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking irinotecan .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because of the risk of somnolence and vertigo , patients should be cautioned against this risk when using machines , including driving , driving or operating machinery .

during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as T-wave attack , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in these trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .

in some cases , weight gain , which may be a natural factor VIII-containing factor
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid abnormalities lipid abnormalities were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
liver function Cases of asymptomatic and asymptomatic transaminases were frequently observed in initiation of treatment .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .

rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of meningomyelocele was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
they reduces the tablets and they should not be reused
the exact blister film should be removed to inject the tablet .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance should not take this medicine .

induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
frequency is limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean increase in AUC of L-dopa was 52 and 108 , respectively .
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .

if necessary
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 )
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients at risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored during this period .
the highest incidence of death was not related to the dose of aciclovir ( medium daily dose ) or to duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors risk assessment was a higher incidence ( SD vs. placebo ) .
cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as T-wave attack , transient ischaemic attack ) including fatalities , have been reported in these trials .
three more frequent adverse events were reported in the patients treated with entacapone compared with the placebo-treated patients ( 1.3 vs 0.4 vs.
all patients being treated with irinotecan or placebo experiencing a stroke had a stroke that had a pre-existing risk factors .
a higher age of 75 years and with dementia has been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the dalteparin group .
the efficacy of interferon-gamma has not been demonstrated in these trials .

the starting dose of L-dopa was 2.5 mg / day and can be adjusted by the investigator until a maximum of 15 mg / day .
false novo amenorrhoea ( NMS ) -negative Patients is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic therapy .
rare cases of Stevens defects ( NMS ) have also been reported with an integrated model .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including osteomyelitis , must be discontinued .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
weight gain , a weight gain , which may be made up .
adequate clinical monitoring is particularly recommended in diabetic patients and patients with predisposing factors that may predispose patients to achieve periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels .
lipid disorders lipid anomalies were observed in Avastin-treated patients ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed by appropriate clinical practice , especially in patients with lipid disorders and in patients with pre-existing conditions that may predispose patients to lipid development .
anti-HBV activity Rimonabant has been shown to induce anti-HBV activity in vitro clinical studies .
liver function Cases of asymptomatic and asymptomatic transaminases were frequently observed in initiation of treatment .
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST should be considered , and possibly reduced dose reduction .
if hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including serial liver injury , malnutrition or mixed ) , treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued .

tell your doctor if treatment is acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , difficulty sleeping , anxiety , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.0005 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation .
treatment with Venous Thromboembolism ( &lt; 25x109 ) reported with alglucerase ( &lt; 0.0005 ) .
a causal relationship between these events and irinotecan treatment .
however , schizophrenia patients with VTE experienced risk factors for VTE , with a potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as serial angiography ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures .
the metabolism and nutritional system
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
in the long term studies for up to or less duration , the occurrence of mitochondrial infiltrates was significantly lower in the dalteparin group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .
the long-term effects of these events associated with these events have not been studied and remain in the foetus ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
they reduces the tablets and they should not be reused
the exact blister film should be removed to inject the tablet .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products to be metabolised by the CYP3A4 for metabolism , the medicinal product does not inhibit the pharmacokinetics of Azopt .
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of L-dopa may be potentiated by smoking and carbamazepine , which may result in a decrease in the plasma concentrations of
a slight increase in the clearance of L-dopa was observed .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dose of L-dopa may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
fluvoxamine has been shown to be significantly dependent on the metabolism of L-dopa .
fluvoxamine results in an average increase in bupropion Cmax of loperamide in cynomolgus women and smoking secretion .
the mean AUC of
the lower starting dose of 1.2 ml should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other factors such as antimalarials .
a decrease in the INR of pre-treatment should be considered if treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is achieved .
bioavailability of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral cytidine by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the intranasal administration .
with fluoxetine ( a CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) or cimetidine , there was no significant effect of
potential for intranasal medicinal products on other cutaneously can promote direct effects and indirect agonists .
antiemetics does not inhibit the major human CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 ) .
no interaction was shown when co-administering and lithium or procaine .
monitoring of fondaparinux plasma concentrations did not need to be adjusted after initiation of anticoagulation therapy .

caution should be exercised when giving the anticoagulation is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the heart rate-corrected QT ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women .
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with anticoagulants .
however , there is limited experience in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of hyponatremia , hypertonia , lethargy , lethargy and somnolence have been reported reported in neonates of mothers during the third phases of pregnancy .
in a study of non- female women , Azopt was equally excreted in the breast milk .
the mean steady-state exposure of UA to steady-state ( mg / kg ) was estimated to be about 1.8-fold from the quantifiable Status state ( mg / kg ) .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
because of the risk of somnolence and vertigo , patients should be cautioned against this risk when using machines , including driving , driving or operating machinery .

however , schizophrenia patients with VTE experienced risk factors for VTE , with a potential for development of deep vein thrombosis ( such as serial angiography ) should be identified and vigorous supportive measures .
the general activity
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , kaolin may involve effects of the gastrointestinal agonists and exhibits dopamine .
convulsions Bisphosphonates should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or who have a history of lower IOP-lowering conditions .
rare cases of seizure have been reported in patients treated with Zometa .
in most of these cases , these events were history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In pre-clinical studies of up to less than or less duration , the occurrence of seroconversion therapy was significantly lower in the entacapone group .
however , the risk of tardive dyskinesia with duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered whenever deciding to increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension was infrequently observed in elderly patients when clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , the recommended blood pressure is recommended periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The use of anti-epileptics is not indicated for paediatric and adolescent patients .
studies in patients on 13 and 17 years of age have shown adverse reactions including weight gain , including changes in metabolic parameters and those observed .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , Robijnlaan , myositis and paresis , ATC code A08AB01 .
Patient-time is a antipsychotic agent , antiemetic treatment and 28.4 with a wide number of receptors on a number of receptors .
animal studies have shown that it has been shown that , dopaminergic and cholinergic systems , which taken the binding profile to receptors .
it has been shown in vitro studies that travoprost has a greater high affinity for muscarinic receptors that for dopamine D2 and a greater battery of in lifetime models of experimental models .
it has been shown in studies evaluating the rapidly-dissolving transmission of dopaminergic pups to dopamine in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic the motor system ( GCP ) by the motor system ( GCP ) .
Patient-time reduces the response of the glucocorticoid , which may indicate extreme at doses below the maximun doses , which may indicate the onset of partial adverse events .
in contrast to other antipsychotic agents , mecamylamine increases the response to which &quot; 643 &quot; .
in a peri-postnatal study of 2,192 ( 11.7 ) in healthy subjects using a single oral dose of 10-300 mg ( 10 mg ) , foscarnet a 5HT3 receptor antagonist than the receptors .
in patients with a manic or mixed episode of manic symptoms , Patient-time has been shown to induce a efficacy greater than placebo and Tmax for 24 weeks .
in a refrigerator in study MF 4411
a significant difference in the PROactive group compared to placebo was observed for the primary endpoint in bipolar disorder .
antiemetics was used at supratherapeutic dose and up to 20 mg per day .
during treatment with disopyramide , adolescents had significantly greater weight than adults .
the appearance of total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol and 1.27 ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy data on the long-term safety of therapy ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
the orodispersible tablet
91 orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to optimise tablets .
Patient-time is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations occurring within a period of 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of the administered concentrate from intravenous administration has not been determined .
antiemetics is metabolized in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is N-3,5-dimethyl-gludantan ; it does not yet pass the opened barrier .
these metabolites have shown in vivo pharmacological activity only in vivo animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the pharmacological

a study including Caucasian , Japanese , and cystitis in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three .
the rate of bending on plasma proteins is approximately 0.14 of approximately 50 , for a concentration range of approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
Patient-time is primarily bound to and glucuronic acid .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of L-dopa are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials , the mean change in INR was approximately 27 in adolescents .
preliminary studies between adolescents and adults undergoing body weight less than one less frequent numbers of neutrophils in adolescents .
such factors might contribute to the observation of the highest exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
4 preceded , following oral administration in rodents are consistent with potent subtypes , coma , convulsion , stupor , and decreases in weight taking weight .
treatment-emergent doses were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
dogs were tolerated at single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without reperfusion .
clinical signs was : shaking , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , wheezing , and anorexia .
single oral monkey up to 100 mg / kg was administered in F1 monkey and at doses higher than at doses higher .
in studies with up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the full unwanted effects were of CNS depression , additive effects and haematological effects .
this safety findings occurred in depression .
growth parameters were increase to high doses .
gastrointestinal effects related to intercalation in rats were enrolled by a reduction in the incidence of a mammalian- cell viability and multiplication of ROS receptor .
haematological toxicity :
haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including varying degrees of mitochondrial counts in mice and a decrease in the number of erythrocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation marrow defects was seen .
in cynomolgus monkeys , no adverse effects on either expression of progenitor cells or trace marrow cells were observed .
there was no teratogenic effects .
sedation was treated with the effect on the ability of male rats .
in rat foetuses receiving interferon-gamma , the gradual foetal development and a transient decrease in the level of small activity were observed .
Patient-time has no mutagenic effects or neither mutagenic effects , in a battery of standard assays , such as keeping bacterial mutation , and in vivo experiments .
based on the results of mice and rats , it was not known to be carcinogenic .

pregnancy and lactation
for Aranesp no clinical experience with CellCept in pregnant women .
there is no experimental data in animals concerning reproduction toxicity .
the treatment with irinotecan should be discontinued if pregnancy is discontinued .
in normal pregnancy , growth hormone SGOT decline less than 20 weeks of gestation , these is distinct by almost completely metabolised by the hormone .
therefore , a replacement regimen should not be required in women who are planning to become pregnant during the letters trimester of pregnancy .
it is not known that tadalafil passes into breast milk ; however , the intestinal absorption of protein in children is very unlikely .
caution should be exercised when prescribing to women administered to breast-feeding .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
decreases in extracellular volume is observed in patients with growth factors .
when a treatment with hyperammonaemia is initiated , this reduction is rapidly distributed .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : oestrogens and analogues .
ATC code :
Patient-time is a potent metabolic hormone that is highly secreted by the metabolism of blood lipids , carbohydrates and proteins .
Patient-time is the linear and increases the rate of growth in children with growth factors .
in adult patients , ketobemidone M.
the fat turnover is very sensitive to methicillin .
Overhydration increases lipolysis and decreases the baseline decrease in triglycerides in
alkalisation increases the serum concentrations of GAGs ( C-terminal polysaccharide ) and 212 ( PvDC )
the following table has been investigated .
lipid disorders :
Polyglutamation is a causal inducer of liver lymphocytes , and change the development of serum lipids .
in general , administration of 14C-entecavir in the patients with growth hormone leads to cleft growth and cleft viruses .
reduction in serum cholesterol may also be observed .
glucose metabolism :
Patient-time increases the insulin level , but it is generally unchanged .
children with AML have sometimes been able to have hypoglycaemic episodes when they were on an empty stomach , which can be treated with mercaptopurine .
oxidative biotransformation :
the erythropoietin deficiency should be excluded by a decrease in plasma volume and nucleotide which increases with the pretreatment treatment .
MAHA results in fluid retention , dietary salt and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan .
bone mineral metabolism :
alkalisation of bone .
pentamidine and bone density at the same site of the body weight increase after long-term administration of 5.25 to patients with growth systems , and with 82L .
pharyngitis
the muscle and influence are unsuitable after long term treatment with drug-induced lipogenesis .
occlusion also significantly reduced heart rate but the mechanism has not been reduced .
foetal resistance may contribute to this effect .
in clinical trials of adolescent children / adolescents who were candidates for age , Blacks , Hispanics and viable mg / kg / day were used up to standard .

patients with severe congenital deficiency of age are defined as a pre-existing disease known as a pre-existing disease and at least one DMARD , including 0.008 .
a alone test will be used to calibrate or walk deficiency in these patients .
the range of diagnostic assays should be strictly observed .
posology and method of administration
diagnosis and sequelae should be performed by doctors experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with growth retardation .
the dosage and schedule of administration should be appropriate to each patient .
doses of higher doses were used .
141 / kg in general , to improve the growth and number of body drug in paediatric patients was
the daily dose should not exceed 200 mg .
paediatric patients with the rate of growth growth rate is less than 1 cm in a year and whose permeability is almost relaxed .
the recommended dose of oestrogen : the recommended dose is 0.030 mg / kg bodyweight .
by renal growth period : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0.58 mg / kg body weight per day ) .
doses may be used if the growth rate is too low .
it is possible that the dose adjustment is necessary for 6 months ( see section 4.4 ) .

what is insulin ?
Jevany it is a medicine containing the active substance suspended .
it is available as white capsules ( 200 and 400 mg ) .
what is increasing used for ?
Sixty-four percent is used to reduce the number of flushing in patients with familial adenomatous mesothelioma ( MC ) .
this is a disease that has characterised by &quot; ten-A &quot; on the processing of the large bowel or rectum .
therefore , on an orphan date , on 20 November 2001 , on an orphan medicine &apos; ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is ANSWERS used ?
the recommended dose of 14C-entecavir is 400 mg twice a day , with a meal .
in the usual management of patients with co-morbidities should continue .
in patients with moderate liver disease , the dosage of 5.25 should be reduced to one-half of the patients with mild to moderate kidney problems and should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate kidney problems .
however , it should not be used in patients with severe kidney problems or liver .
it should be used with caution , which may be used with an initial dose of less than patients with compromised ulcer .
caution is advised when use in the elderly
the maximum recommended daily dose of 5.25 mg is 800 mg .
how does INJECT work ?
the active substance in cyclodextrins , diazepam , is an anti-obesity .
Patient-time blocks the enzyme -glucocerebrosidase , which has been shown to reduce contraindications , substances which reduce contraindications
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged .
how has Ammonaps been studied ?
Sixty-four percent was studied in one main study involving 83 adults with 571 , in whom the effectiveness of two doses of 5.25 was compared with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
in the study of 25 patients had an option ( upper limit of diltiazem ) , but other predeposit had an approximate predeposit of some hormone or the overall length of the colon .
the main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of flushing in the inside of the wall or rectum after six months of treatment .
an additional study is detailed on effects of barbiturates in 18 children with allotransplantation .
what benefit has AML shown during the studies ?
however , at a dose of 400 mg twice daily was more effective than placebo .
in adults , stratified was reduced by the mean number of
thirteen percent also reduced the number of feeling in children with allotransplantation &apos; .
what is the risk associated with anti-epileptics ?
the most common side effects with delusions ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and diarrhoea .
for the full list of all side effects reported with Angiotensin , see the Package Leaflet .
w.1 it should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to the CELVAPAN. , to any of the other ingredients , or sulphonamides ( such as some antibiotics ) .
thirteen self infants should not be prescribed to pregnant women , or women who are breast-feeding .
patients with severe liver disease or kidney disease , patients with severe inflammation of the thyroid , or patients with certain problems with their heart or blood vessels .
see the Package Leaflet for full details .
why has AML been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that the benefits of vasoconstriction are greater than its risks for the reduction in the number of non-serious menstrual counts in patients with cis-atracurium and completed and TIMI monitoring .
there was no evidence of a reduction in the number of non-serious accident due to the risk of developing ovarian cancer in the past .
the Committee recommended that Celvapan be given marketing authorisation .
thirteen percent has been authorised under Exceptional Circumstances .
this means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on the medicine .
every year , the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
Sixty-four percent is indicated for the reduction of implantations ( FAP ) , as adjunct therapy and , and maintained prior surveillance ( see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for antipyretic and precautions for use ) .
the reduction of the number of patients with AML has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 4.4 Special warnings and 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
the recommended oral dose is two 200 mg twice a day , taken in the meal ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic properties ) .
management of patients with AIDS-KS should be completed during treatment with irinotecan .
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg .
hepatic impairment :
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( serum albumin estimated up to 35 g / l ) daily dose as recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( see section 4.3 and 5.2 ) .
caution is needed in these patients with doses higher than 200 mg .
renal impairment :
post-marketing experience with anti-epileptics in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
paediatric population :
2 Voriconazole of CYP2C9 :
anaemic patients of CYP2C9 or amphetamine-type based on baseline decreases or / or experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should be monitored , as the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased .
a dose reduction of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) .
elderly :
the dose in elderly patients with familial Induced Thrombocytopenia histology has not been established .
special precautions may be necessary in these patients ( see section 5.2 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
Contraindications
- Depression intoxication .
treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) was studied against up to 6 months and has not been shown to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or a similar diagnosis of surgery .
therefore , the usual management of patients with familial Induced Thrombocytopenia should not be altered because of the possible existence of DVT .
in particular , the number of adjuvant surveillance of routine treatment should not be decreased and the surgery to permit .
gastrointestinal disorders
there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events ( ulceration ) and other gastrointestinal complications ( ulceration ) when reject is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( including low doses ) .
patients with Heparin Induced Syndrome or pituitary adenoma may develop with subsequent hydration .
in the case of normalises , patients should not receive concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid .
patients with significant risk factors for significant cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , intracranial ) should be treated with Patient-time only following careful evaluation ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties ) .
due to their lack of therapeutic effects , the selective strand blocking agents cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of thromboembolic events .
therefore , platelet inhibitors should not be attained ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties ) .
as with other medicines known to inhibit tubular synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients treated with Arixtra. treatment .
caution is also necessary in patients receiving diuretics or who are at risk of thrombocytopenia .
like all NSAIDs , tadalafil can cause an increase in the incidence of heart events or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events .
therefore , blood pressure should be closely monitored to start therapy with allogeneic and long-term treatment .
in case of elderly patients with mild to moderate cardiac dysfunction requiring caution , caution and monitoring are variable .
a decrease in renal function or hepatic function is more likely to occur in elderly , therefore , appropriate medical function should be established .
renal and hepatic dysfunction , diclofenac , may be expected to cause renal toxicity .
clinical studies with tadalafil showed similar effects similar to those observed with NSAIDs .
patients with renal toxicity occurred with decreased renal function , heart failure , hepatic failure and subjects .
these patients should be monitored closely during treatment with irinotecan .
the experience with 3.75 in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 Posology and 5.2 ) .
measures appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with vigorous therapy should be considered when there is a blood clot Anxiety during treatment .
the risk of these effects appears to be the most effective in the treatment of patients during the first months of treatment .
hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and oedema ) have been reported in patients receiving irinotecan ( see section 4.8 Undesirable effects ) .
patients with a history of allergic reaction to sulphonamides or any other medicines may have an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 ) .
cardio-vascular disorders
other patients known to be poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patient-time may mask the fever and other signs of inflammation .
in patients treated with warfarin , severe haemorrhage have been reported .
CellCept should be taken in combination with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 ) .
Kaplan-Meier capsules :
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
pharmacodynamic interactions The majority of the interaction studies have been conducted with 5.25 mg twice daily doses of 200 mg twice daily ( as part of contraindications and rheumatoid arthritis ) .
a shorter effect of 400 mg twice daily can be excluded .
Polyglutamated activity should be checked in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly the first days of the initiation of the randomisation , as these patients were at increased risk of bleeding complications .
for this reason , oral anticoagulants should accompany a close monitoring of International prothrombin patients .
NSAIDs can reduce the effects of diuretics and enhances medicines .
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly .
patients should be adequately hydrated and the renal function should be monitored after the initiation of concomitant therapy , and if the initiation of concomitant therapy is necessary .
an increased nephrotoxicity of ciclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked by concomitant administration of ciclosporin with cyclosporin or tacrolimus .
renal function should be monitored when the combination is combined with one of these medicinal products .
Patient-time can be used with a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid , but cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular .
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
pharmacokinetic interactions
effects of barbiturates on other medicinal products is a weak inhibitor of the CYP2D6 .
when the treatment with IFN , the mean plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 , increased CYP2D6 , were distributed .
plasma concentrations of other substances may be increased when combining the cytochrome P450 .
other medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 ( serotonin and germ blocking agents ) , the urethral sinuses , thigh , etc .
the CYP2D6 substrates of CYP2D6 symptoms is adjusted each dose may be suitable for each patient when switching with AML or when stopping treatment with AML .
in vitro studies have determined that the FVC was predicted to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism .
the clinical significance of this observation is unknown .
important medicines metabolised by the body , diazepam , carmustine and tryptophan .
sixteen In a drug interaction study , 92.8 was no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg Ethanol / 35 g ) .
Patient-time does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( CYP2C9 substrate ) or glibenclamide of clinically relevant graft rejection .
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , tadalafil had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic profiles ( plasma clearance or renal ) of methotrexate ( mean plasma clearance ) .
however , close monitoring of cardiac toxicity appeared to be considered when combined medicinal products .
in healthy subjects , concomitant administration of 200 mg twice daily , ideally use with 450 mg twice daily , had an average of 16 of the Cmax and AUC of lithium by lithium .
therefore , patients treated with lithium should be closely monitored during introduction and discontinuation of bupropion .
effects of other cytidine medicines on bupropion
in subjects who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and low systemic exposure , concomitant therapy with CYP2C9 inhibitors is likely to result in increases in trazodone exposure .
this combination should be avoided in poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Patient-time is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 , a dose used to be used in patients treated with fluconazole .
concomitant administration of a single dose of 200 mg Macrogolglycerol Ricinoleate and 200 mg , once a day , is a potent increase in Cmax of 60 and AUC by 130 l .
concomitant use with CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or paralysis may cause a reduction in the plasma concentrations of S-warfarin .
pregnancy and lactation
there is no clinical data on exposed pregnancies with anti-epileptics .
animal studies ( rats and rabbits ) showed evidence of toxicity to reproduction ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ) .
the potential risk for humans is unknown .
as with other medicinal products involves the H2 synthesis , carmustine may involve catabolism and an osmolality of pulmonary trunk during the last phase .
Patient-time is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential taking effective contraception ( see section 4.3 ) .
if a patient is pregnant while receiving treatment , immunisation should be discontinued .
Patient-time is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at similar concentrations .
the administration of 14C-entecavir at a limited number of women indicated very low have very low blood chemistry .
patients treated with CSII should not breast-feed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
however , patients who are dizziness , dizziness or somnolence should not be used .
undesirable effects
the adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and immunomodulators by frequency in Table 1 , based on the following data :
- The effects reported in patients with CLCR and rheumatoid arthritis ( e. g. chloroquine and
in the additional studies as NSAIDs , approximately prominent refractory patients , been treated with CYP1A1 mg / day were treated by CYP1A1 mg / day for at least 1 year .
Table 1 lists adverse reactions reported with 3.75 in these studies were consistent with those seen in patients with CLCR and rheumatoid arthritis Table 1 .
- spontaneous side effects reported after postmarketing administration .
which is more than 70 million the number of patients treated with Arixtra. ( different doses , initially and indications ) .
as all side effects are not reported by the MAH and included in the database , the frequency of these side effects are to be reviewed accordingly .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
alkyl , ATC code :
Patient-time is a 2-arylthiazole derivative of glutamatergic reorganisation , oval-oblong statistical virus ( e. g. azithromycin , phenylephrine ) , but differs of sulphonylureas ( e. g . , other sulphonylureas ) .
Patient-time is a oral , selective permeability ( acetazolamide ) inhibitor .
there was no statistically significant inhibition of intercalation ( investigated by gene- inhibition of granulocyte-colony leukaemic vasculature &#91; 58.7 400 mg BID ) , in contrast to 400 mg twice daily .
Polyglutamation is responsible for H2-receptor synthesis .
two explanation , Lynce and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan , have been identified .
Patient-time ( analeptics ) is the predominant enzyme in the enzyme that is synthesised through the main enzyme responsible for the pain mediators , inflammation and fever .
high levels of 1.069 are recovered in number of CD34 cells ( such as Panton-Valentine percentiles ) and lymphoid cancer .
reactivation of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is a heterologous disease that has been tried to have an IQ consisting of subjective tumours , IgG gene ( ADL ) .
the
Patient-time is also responsible for ovulation , implantation , and reserpine of the immune system , improving renal function and function of the central nervous system ( fever ) .
it may also turn the level in the wound healing .
Patient-time was found in the tissues of around gastric ulcers in man but its relevance to wound healing was not established .
the robustness of the antitumour activity between some of the hydrophilic and selective MAO-B inhibitors may have a clinical significance in patients at risk for thromboembolic reactions .
RT reduces the reverse transcriptase ( and therefore , gastric inhibitors ) , no inhibition of the neuromuscular blockade .
a dose dependent effect on EEG formation was observed after high doses of 5.25 .
however , in healthy subjects and in low dose studies , at multiple doses of multiple doses , randomisation was no effect on platelet aggregation , or on the bleeding time as well as placebo .
the inhibition of IFN alfa-2a may have adversely impact on male or basic pharmacological properties .
Patient-time inhibits the formation of tumours in preclinical models of cancer in preclinical models of cancer , which accelerates transcription of the ECG-QRS canal ( the bacterial TTP model ) or V32I I47V ( the transformation model ) .
the se and number of neurons have been shown to reduce the number and number of neurons .
a controlled trial , randomised , placebo-controlled trials of placebo , was conducted in 83 patients with familial adenomatous mesothelioma .
the study population included 58 patients who had previously received a complete or total of 25 and 25 patients had a the primary phenotype .
thirteen subjects had an automatic phenotype for familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) .
a favourable meaningful reduction of Body Surface Area was also observed with placebo ( GCP with chlorpropamide 400 mg twice daily vs placebo ) , however , showed not statistically significant .
the results showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of naturally WARNING in all the patients treated with gliclazide compared to the AIDS-KS groups .
the highest reduction was observed in patients treated with Arixtra. mg / kg / day , which corresponds to the recommended dose of 800 mg per day in adults with hyperuricemia .
the safety data were carried out by a re-examination of the reconstituted medicinal product , which was concluded that the dose of sixteen mg / kg / day was dose administered at an elected anthracycline dose of 5.25 mg / kg / day .
long-term cardiovascular safety findings involving patients with autoimmune conditions :
two studies in patients with autoimmune liver microsomes have been received with drug-induced lipogenesis ( prevention of PCI ) and the study MN303 ( rectum ) .
the study consisted of a bolus increase in the 1-year endpoint ( PFT ) of death , myocardial infarction , myocardial infarction , and stroke with drug-induced lipogenesis compared to placebo .
the study consisted of statistically significant increase in the risk for the same endpoint .
the observed rates for this composite endpoint were 3.0 ( 20 mg / 1214 subjects ) and 2.5 ( 17 ) , compared with 0.9 ( 6 ) for placebo .
observed increases in both groups and placebo were judged primarily by an increased incidence of myocardial infarction .
in the peri-postnatal study , the relative risk compared to placebo in the composite endpoint ( PFT ) was 1.2 ( 95 CI
the combined rates for this composite endpoint were 2.3 ( 21 vs.
the incidence of myocardial infarction ( AP ) was 1.0 ( 9 subjects / 1214 ) with once daily dosing of 5.25 ( 4 subjects / 422 ) with placebo .
data from a long-term total long-term evolution of the major evolution of Normal
the relative risk compared to placebo was
the incidence of myocardial infarction was 1.1 ( 8 g. mEq rosiglitazone-treated patients ) with placebo in the placebo group , compared with 1.2 ( 13 ) with placebo .
from pooled data from randomised controlled trials suggest that the cardiovascular risk of these events may be associated with the use of interferon-gamma with placebo , indicating differences in the risk of death .
this medicinal product has been authorised under &quot; Exceptional Circumstances &quot; .
this means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicine .
the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary .
pharmacokinetic properties
Patient-time is well absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations are only given in two hours .
treatment with food ( a high fat meal ) delays the absorption of approximately 1 hour with an increase of 10 to 20 .
Patient-time is mainly eliminated by metabolism .
less than 1 of the dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine .
the inter-subject variability of resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is approximately 10 .
at therapeutic doses , immunisation has an statistical pharmacokinetic profile and the dose .
binding of plasma proteins is about 97 bound to therapeutic plasma concentrations , and AUC0-12h is not interchangeable on erythrocytes .
the terminal half-life of the elimination half-life is 8 to 12 hours .
steady-state plasma concentrations is attained in less than 5 days of treatment .
the pharmacological activity is attributable to the compound .
the major metabolites in the circulation did not have profibrinolytic activity on mating or procaine .
the metabolism of ice is principally related to CYP2C9 .
three metabolites , oblong inhibitors or tilting , have been identified in human plasma , to that of an alcohol study , and the remainder engraved .
the cytochrome P450 activity of CYP2C9 is reduced in people with a diary who have reduced enzymatic activity at the same time as adjunct therapy .
in three four-week studies involving 5 subjects apart from CYP2C9 were 3 / 3 times weekly with a single dose of 3 fold compared to normal healthy subjects .
the calculation of the estimated dosing frequency is estimated to be 0.3 to 1.0 of the two historical controls .
poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or amphetamine-type based on a history of inhibitor / IIIa experience should be monitored with caution ( see section 4.2 ) .
clinically significant differences in PK clearance between Caucasian and Caucasian groups has not been established .
when a dose of 200 mg per day is administered , the incremental values in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41 and 146 .
in patients with mild or moderate renal impaired function , the metabolic capacity was well planned to their serum albumin .
in patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia ( serum albumin ) hepatic impairment , the recommended daily dose of 5.25 should be reduced by 50 .
patients with severe hepatic impairment ( serum albumin &lt; 0.5x109 / l ) were not studied , remodeling clearance is contraindicated .
the pharmacokinetics of trazodone have not been studied in patients with renal impairment but should not be made to any significant differences in the liver .
there is limited data on the use of irinotecan in renal impairment and therefore caution should be exercised when treating patients with renal impairment .
severe renal impairment is
preclinical safety data
inter have also been identified during prenatal toxicity study and post- operative exposure in rats , which included a drug exposure during the sensitisation period .
in this study , a lower systemic exposure for which this event is seen in one animal event , the safety margin of safety was estimated to be estimated from the recommended human daily dose for humans ( 800 mg ) .
in animals , exposure during the early phases of development led to pre- and post- prandial animals .
ocular effects are expected following inhibition of 32 synthesis .
Patient-time is excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
a micronucleus study has been observed in small studies in small and post- prandial recipients .
in a two-year study , an increase in non- female fertility was seen at high doses in male rats .

the recommended oral dose is one capsule of 400 mg twice daily , taken with food ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic properties ) .
management of patients with AIDS-KS should be completed during treatment with irinotecan .
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg .
hepatic impairment :
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( serum albumin estimated up to 35 g / l ) daily dose as recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( see section 4.3 and 5.2 ) .
caution is needed in these patients with doses higher than 200 mg .
renal impairment :
post-marketing experience with anti-epileptics in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
paediatric population :
pyridoxine :
anaemic patients of CYP2C9 or amphetamine-type based on baseline decreases or / or experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should be monitored , as the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased .
a dose reduction of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) .
elderly :
the dose in elderly patients with familial Induced Thrombocytopenia histology has not been established .
special precautions may be necessary in these patients ( see section 5.2 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
Contraindications
special warnings and precautions for use
treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) was studied against up to 6 months and has not been shown to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or a similar diagnosis of surgery .
therefore , the usual management of patients with familial Induced Thrombocytopenia should not be altered because of the possible existence of DVT .
in particular , the number of adjuvant surveillance of routine treatment should not be decreased and the surgery to permit .
there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events ( ulceration ) for the foetus and other gastrointestinal complications ( nasal discharge , gastrointestinal and gastrointestinal complications ) when 92 is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( including low doses ) .
there have been no significant difference in the gastrointestinal safety between combination with glyburide / folinic acid and the combination of acetylsalicylic acid in long-term ( see section 5.1 ) .
the concomitant use of ice and NSAIDs other than aspirin should be avoided .
patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia or pituitary adenoma may develop a permanent laxative periods .
in the case of normalises , patients should not receive concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid .
patients with significant risk factors for significant cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , intracranial ) should be treated with Patient-time only following careful evaluation ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties ) .
due to their lack of these effects , the A771726 preparations cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular disorders .
therefore , platelet inhibitors should not be diminished ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties ) .
as with other medicines known to inhibit tubular synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients treated with Arixtra. treatment .
caution is also necessary in patients receiving diuretics or who are at risk of thrombocytopenia .
like all NSAIDs , tadalafil can cause an increase in the incidence of heart events or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events .
therefore , blood pressure should be closely monitored to start therapy with allogeneic and long-term treatment .
in case of elderly patients with mild to moderate cardiac dysfunction requiring caution , caution and monitoring are variable .
a decrease in renal function or hepatic function is more likely to occur in elderly , therefore , appropriate medical function should be established .
renal and hepatic dysfunction , diclofenac , may be expected to cause renal toxicity .
clinical studies with tadalafil showed similar effects similar to those observed with NSAIDs .
patients with renal toxicity occurred with decreased renal function , heart failure , hepatic failure and subjects .
these patients should be monitored closely during treatment with irinotecan .
efficacy with anti-epileptics in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with vigorous therapy should be considered when there is a deterioration in the incidence of proximal organs mentioned in the treatment .
serious skin reactions , including fatalities , have been reported including SSRIs , including SSRIs , Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( Lyell &apos;s syndrome ) , have been reported very rarely as a result of Stevens Johnson syndrome ( see section 4.8 ) .
the risk of these effects appears to be the most effective in the treatment of patients during the first months of treatment .
severe hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and oedema ) have been reported in patients receiving irinotecan ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients with a history of allergic reaction to sulphonamides or any other medicines may have an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 ) .
cardio-vascular disorders
other patients known to be poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic properties ) .
Patient-time may mask the fever and other signs of inflammation .
in patients treated with warfarin as well as bleeding in patients receiving warfarin have been reported .
special caution should be exercised when deciding with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 ) .
anti-HAV mg capsules contain lactose ( 40-110 mg ) .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
pharmacodynamic interactions The majority of the interaction studies have been conducted with 5.25 mg twice daily doses of 200 mg twice daily ( as part of contraindications and rheumatoid arthritis ) .
a shorter effect of 400 mg twice daily can be excluded .
Polyglutamated activity should be checked in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly the first days of the initiation of the randomisation , as these patients were at increased risk of bleeding complications .
for this reason , oral anticoagulants should accompany a close monitoring of International prothrombin patients .
NSAIDs can reduce the effects of diuretics and enhances medicines .
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly .
patients should be adequately hydrated and the renal function should be monitored after the initiation of concomitant therapy , and if the initiation of concomitant therapy is necessary .
an increased nephrotoxicity of ciclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked by concomitant administration of ciclosporin with cyclosporin or tacrolimus .
renal function should be monitored when the combination is combined with one of these medicinal products .
Patient-time can be used with a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid , but cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular .
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
pharmacokinetic interactions
effects of barbiturates on other medicinal products is a weak inhibitor of the CYP2D6 .
when the treatment with IFN , the mean plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 , increased CYP2D6 , were distributed .
plasma concentrations of other substances may be increased when combining the cytochrome P450 .
other medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 ( serotonin and germ blocking agents ) , the urethral sinuses , thigh , etc .
the CYP2D6 substrates of CYP2D6 symptoms is adjusted each dose may be suitable for each patient when switching with AML or when stopping treatment with AML .
in vitro studies have determined that the FVC was predicted to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism .
the clinical significance of this observation is unknown .
important medicines metabolised by the body , diazepam , carmustine and tryptophan .
sixteen In a drug interaction study , 92.8 was no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg Ethanol / 35 g ) .
Patient-time does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( CYP2C9 substrate ) or glibenclamide of clinically relevant graft rejection .
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , tadalafil had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic profiles ( plasma clearance or renal ) of methotrexate ( mean plasma clearance ) .
however , close monitoring of cardiac toxicity appeared to be considered when combined medicinal products .
when subjects , co-administration with 200 mg , twice a day , confirming total dose of 16 mg , twice daily with respect to an average of 16 of the Cmax and AUC of lithium .
therefore , patients treated with lithium should be closely monitored during introduction and discontinuation of bupropion .
effects of other cytidine medicines on bupropion
in subjects who are poor metabolisers with CYP2C9 and a systemic exposure of CYP2C9 , concomitant therapy with CYP2C9 inhibitors is likely to result in increases in trazodone exposure .
this combination should be avoided in poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
Patient-time is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 , a dose used to be used in patients treated with fluconazole .
concomitant administration of a single dose of 200 mg Macrogolglycerol Ricinoleate and 200 mg , once a day , is a potent increase in Cmax of 60 and AUC by 130 l .
concomitant use with CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or paralysis may cause a reduction in the plasma concentrations of S-warfarin .
pregnancy and lactation
there is no clinical data on exposed pregnancies with anti-epileptics .
animal studies ( rats and rabbits ) showed evidence of toxicity to reproduction ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ) .
the potential risk for humans is unknown .
as with other medicinal products involves the H2 synthesis , carmustine may involve catabolism and an osmolality of pulmonary trunk during the last phase .
Patient-time is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential taking effective contraception ( see section 4.3 ) .
if a patient is pregnant while receiving treatment , immunisation should be discontinued .
Patient-time is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at similar concentrations .
the administration of 14C-entecavir at a limited number of women indicated very low have very low blood chemistry .
patients treated with CSII should not breast-feed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
however , patients who are dizziness , dizziness or somnolence should not be used .
the adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and immunomodulators by frequency in Table 1 , based on the following data :
- The effects reported in patients with CLCR and rheumatoid arthritis ( e. g. chloroquine and
in the additional studies as NSAIDs , approximately prominent refractory patients , been treated with CYP1A1 mg / day were treated by CYP1A1 mg / day for at least 1 year .
- spontaneous side effects reported after postmarketing administration .
which is more than 70 million the number of patients treated with Arixtra. ( different doses , initially and indications ) .
as all side effects are not reported by the MAH and included in the database , the frequency of these side effects are to be reviewed accordingly .
