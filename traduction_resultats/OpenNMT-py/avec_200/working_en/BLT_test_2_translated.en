pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code A08AB01 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in an investigational study , sixteen ( PDE5 ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of oral
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , destroys the efficacy of desloratadine and valproate sodium responses in the fasted state and by valproate sodium symptoms over 3 weeks .
glycosylation has also been shown to indicate efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of manic symptoms and depressive symptoms 6 and 12 weeks .
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the majority of the reports of total cholesterol in total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
België / h :
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
28.6 for humans , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( back mg ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
similar differences between adolescents and adults are body weight lower than the body &apos;s status less than adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
signs of toxicity following oral administration in rodents are varying of potent immunosuppressive agents : ensuring , tremor , convulsions , tremors , and decreased weight gain .
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
in studies with up to three months duration of up to 3 months in mice and dogs , the desired effects were depression , and haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the reversible inhibitory effects of trazodone in female rats showed reduced weight loss and contractility , cytogenic modifications of the motor epithelium and -L-iduronidase -L-iduronidase .
haematological toxicity :
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
glycosylation has no teratogenic effects .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
glycosylation was not mutagenic nor clastogenic or clastogenic effects in a standard battery of standard assays such as viral mutation and in vivo cytotoxicity to polyvinyl Protein and in vivo .
based on results in mice and rats , the persistence of the studies was not carcinogenic .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code A08AB01 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in an investigational study , sixteen ( PDE5 ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of oral
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
glycosylation has also been shown to indicate efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of manic symptoms and depressive symptoms 6 and 12 weeks .
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the majority of the reports of total cholesterol in total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
28.6 for healthy subjects ( 65 years of age and older ) , compared with young subjects ( 62.6 vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
28.6 for humans , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( back mg ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
similar differences between adolescents and adults are body weight lower than the body &apos;s status less than adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
signs of toxicity following oral administration in rodents are varying of potent immunosuppressive agents : ensuring , tremor , convulsions , tremors , and decreased weight gain .
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
24 Studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the desired effects were depression , synergistic systemic and haematological disturbances .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the reversible inhibitory effects of trazodone in female rats showed reduced weight loss and contractility , cytogenic modifications of the motor epithelium and -L-iduronidase -L-iduronidase .
haematological toxicity :
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
glycosylation has no teratogenic effects .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
mutagenicity
glycosylation was not mutagenic nor clastogenic or clastogenic effects in a standard battery of standard assays such as viral mutation and in vivo cytotoxicity to polyvinyl Protein and in vivo .
based on results in mice and rats , the persistence of the studies was not carcinogenic .

in some cases , weight gain may be associated with a differing weight , has been reported .
monitoring of clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with severe and in patients with severe risk factors for which periodic monitoring of blood glucose is recommended .
lipid anomalies were observed in patients treated with anti-epileptics during clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed as clinically appropriate , especially in those with lipid disorders and in patients with predisposing factors that may result in lipid development .
however , there is limited clinical experience experience with however the clinical experience of safety , efficacy experience .
as a limited measure is in patients with pre-existing symptoms associated with the condition , caution should be exercised when prescribing to patients with compromised hypertrophy , pulmonary obstruction or any other disease .
periodic monitoring of liver function elevations and asymptomatic increases in transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were commonly observed .
occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be considered and may result in a dose reduction .
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including pharyngolaryngeal liver damage , erosion or mixed ) , treatment with &apos; &apos; should be discontinued .
4 neutropenia has been reported with the concomitant use of -methyldopa and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) .

a causal relationship of these events has not been established between the occurrence of late and late treatment .
however , in patients with severe progressive risk factors for Venous Thrombo- Embolism ( such as Panton-Valentine discharge ) should be identified and vigorous contraceptive measures applied as necessary .
avoid the general central nervous system effects back on the suckling compartment , gastrointestinal effects and caution should be exercised when taken with alcohol and alcohol .
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , glycosylation may exacerbate the effects of the direct agonists and indirect dopamine .
seizures - Seizures
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with lepirudin .
in most of these cases , there were a patient with a history of convulsions .

however , the risk of experiencing dyskinesia dyskinesia decreases with the duration of exposure to the treatment discontinuation , and upon discontinuation of treatment should be considered as medically indicated .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .

lactose Application tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactase malabsorption should not take this medicine .
the product contains soya lecithin .
when treating patients to peanut or soya do not take these tablets .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products that inhibit prolactin metabolism with CYP1A2 is metabolized by CYP1A2 , products that are metabolised by CYP1A2 , which may affect the pharmacokinetics of G-CSFs .
induction of CYP1A2 metabolism
there is a small increase in clearance of -L-iduronidase and ranges .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close clinical monitoring is recommended and an increased dose of -L-iduronidase may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
C09C A04 .
fluvoxamine induced an increase in Cmax of carbamoyl Cmax by 16 in females and 77 for smokers .
the mean AUC of hyperammonaemia was 52 and 108 , respectively .
starting dose of
a decrease in the dose of -L-iduronidase should be considered if treatment with a CYP1A2 inhibitor is found .

Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code A08AB01 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in an investigational study , sixteen ( PDE5 ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of oral
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
efficacy results showed comparable efficacy results with respect to haloperidol in terms of patients in remission after remission from mania as well as in the
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the majority of the reports of total cholesterol in total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
28.6 for healthy subjects ( 65 years of age and older ) per healthy subjects , the mean elimination half-life of ranitidine is prolonged ( -4.0 vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
AUC0- in man , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 79.9 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( back mg ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
similar differences between adolescents and adults are body weight lower than the body &apos;s status less than adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
signs of toxicity following oral administration in rodents are varying of potent immunosuppressive agents : ensuring , tremor , convulsions , tremors , and decreased weight gain .
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
in studies with up to three months duration of up to 3 months in mice and dogs , the desired effects were depression , and haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .

haematological toxicity :
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
glycosylation has no teratogenic effects .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
glycosylation was not mutagenic nor clastogenic or clastogenic effects in a standard battery of standard assays such as viral mutation and in vivo cytotoxicity to polyvinyl Protein and in vivo .
based on results in mice and rats , the persistence of the studies was not carcinogenic .

special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored for this period .
the incidence of death was not related to the dose-dependent dose of -L-iduronidase ( cumulative daily dose of cisplatin ) or the duration of treatment .
in this patient population , age in age , one and two years of age , alcoholism , hypophosphataemia , and dehydration , ( such as coughing with or without features ) or concurrent use of concomitant use is recommended .
however , independently of these factors were noted in the maternal group ( compared to placebo ) .
vascular events ( such as between cerebrovascular accident , ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in the same trials .
three times more adverse events were reported in the patients treated with Ammonaps compared with placebo in patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 respectively ) .
all patients being treated with anti-epileptics or placebo had a stroke related to pre-existing risk factors .
age , 75 years and dementia of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a dependent with type 2 diabetes mellitus was identified as risk factors in the foetus .
the efficacy of pravastatin has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients were to be 83 in the early study of the previous treatment regimen ( subtypes ) and resume the same strength , on the same dose for the previous treatment regimen .
the starting dose of amiodarone was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator as a maximum of 15 mg / day .

if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including fatalities .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
in some cases , weight gain may be associated with a differing weight , has been reported .
monitoring of clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with severe and in patients with severe risk factors for which periodic monitoring of blood glucose is recommended .
lipid anomalies were observed in patients treated with anti-epileptics during clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed as clinically appropriate , especially in those with lipid disorders and in patients with predisposing factors that may result in lipid development .
antitumour activity confirm that malfunctioning of the suppressor activity in vitro , the incidence of this activity has been low in clinical trials .
however , in patients with compromised corneas , ileus or any other disease .
periodic monitoring of liver function elevations and asymptomatic increases in transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were commonly observed .
occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be considered and may result in a dose reduction .
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including pharyngolaryngeal liver damage , erosion or mixed ) , treatment with &apos; &apos; should be discontinued .
4 neutropenia has been reported with the concomitant use of -methyldopa and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Withdrawal symptoms such as constipation , insomnia , tremor , drowsiness , nausea , vomiting , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 25x109 ) during abrupt treatment .
disorders of patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely during post-approval use .
a causal relationship of these events has not been established between the occurrence of late and late treatment .
however , in patients with severe progressive risk factors , the factor risk factor for
avoid the general central nervous system effects back on the suckling compartment , gastrointestinal effects and caution should be exercised when taken with alcohol and alcohol .
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , glycosylation may exacerbate the effects of the direct agonists and indirect dopamine .
rare cases of
convulsions have been reported in patients treated with insulin .
in most of these cases , there were a patient with a history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In retrospective studies of less than one year or less duration , the occurrence of ROS was significantly lower in the maternal group .
however , the risk of experiencing dyskinesia dyskinesia decreases with the duration of exposure to the treatment discontinuation , and upon discontinuation of treatment should be considered as medically indicated .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension has been observed rarely in elderly subjects in clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , blood pressure should be monitored periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The physiological use of children is not indicated in children and adolescents .
studies in patients with age 17 years of age have shown adverse events , including weight gain and demonstrated blood levels of 384 .
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and independent of pioglitazone ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Application tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactase malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products that inhibit prolactin metabolism with CYP1A2 is metabolized by CYP1A2 , products that are metabolised by CYP1A2 , which may affect the pharmacokinetics of G-CSFs .
induction of CYP1A2 metabolism
there is a small increase in clearance of -L-iduronidase and ranges .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close clinical monitoring is recommended and an increased dose of -L-iduronidase may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
C09C A04 .
fluvoxamine induced an increase in Cmax of carbamoyl Cmax by 16 in females and 77 for smokers .
the mean AUC of hyperammonaemia was 52 and 108 , respectively .
starting dose of
a decrease in the dose of -L-iduronidase should be considered if treatment with a CYP1A2 inhibitor is found .
activated charcoal trough levels by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of G-CSFs .
14 Isolated fluoxetine ( aluminium inhibitor , magnesium ) single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) have not been observed .
similar effects of hyperammonaemia on other medicines can suppress the direct and indirect agonists of dopaminergic agonists .
glycosylation of the CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. cytochrome P450 , 2C9 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , ) .
no interaction was demonstrated when taken concomitantly with -methyldopa and lithium .
in the valproate of the valproate and forty plasma levels , the dose of the omeprazole dose should not be adjusted .
3 The caution is recommended in patients who are going to swallow or who are being treated with anticonvulsive agents of the central nervous system .
the use of N-methyl-D-aspartate and medicinal products judged in patients with Li-Fraumeni disease is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
heart rate-corrected corticosteroid should be administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials of lactating women .
patients should be instructed to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Ammonaps .
however , the experience in women is limited , ultrasound should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of serotonin , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been reported in neonates after the person , pregnancy .
in a study in women , regeneration was found in breast milk .
the average exposure of the steady-state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 350 of the urethra dose as well as the mother ( in mg / kg ) .
breast-feeding women are advised not to breast feed if they are depressed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be aware about this risk when using machines , including driving of driving .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
neoplasms benign , 330 and oxyfenbutazone , ATC code J07BC20 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater

Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in a 2-year 18-week study
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
glycosylation has also been shown to demonstrate efficacy results comparable to haloperidol in patients in remission as well as 31 and 12 weeks .
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the alterations in fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents .
what to adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
31.1 ( CV vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
28.6 for humans , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( drip ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
there is 3 years of age and adults unable to body weight less than 18 and lower , respectively .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
repeated dose toxicity studies in up to 3 months duration of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year were depression , and peripheral haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the reversible inhibitory effects of trazodone in female rats showed reduced weight loss and contractility , cytogenic modifications of the motor epithelium and -L-iduronidase -L-iduronidase .
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
reproduction toxicity There was no teratogenic effect .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
mutagenicity Although neither mutagenic nor clastogenic effects in a complete manner , such as mutation of the a standard battery of tests , such as viral mutation and in vivo .
carcinogenicity ( adverse reactions ) in mice and rats , was designated that glycosylation is not carcinogenic .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , 55.3 , myositis and paresis , PART .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in a 2-year 18-week study
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
glycosylation has also been shown to demonstrate efficacy results comparable to haloperidol in patients in remission as well as 31 and 12 weeks .
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the alterations in fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents .
what to adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
31.1 ( CV vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
28.6 for humans , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( drip ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
30 Children and adults are unable to body weight lower than 18 and less pronounced in adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
repeated dose toxicity studies in up to 3 months duration of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year were depression , and peripheral haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the reversible inhibitory effects of trazodone in female rats showed reduced weight loss and contractility , cytogenic modifications of the motor epithelium and -L-iduronidase -L-iduronidase .
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
reproduction toxicity There was no teratogenic effect .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
mutagenicity Although neither mutagenic nor clastogenic effects in a complete manner , such as mutation of the a standard battery of tests , such as viral mutation and in vivo .
carcinogenicity ( adverse reactions ) in mice and rats , was designated that glycosylation is not carcinogenic .

patients with an increased risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored for this period .
the incidence of death was not related to the dose-dependent dose of -L-iduronidase ( cumulative daily dose of cisplatin ) or the duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors were noted in the maternal group ( compared to placebo ) .
vascular events ( such as between cerebrovascular accident , ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in the same trials .
three times more adverse events were reported in the patients treated with Ammonaps compared with placebo in patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 respectively ) .
all patients being treated with anti-epileptics or placebo had a stroke related to pre-existing risk factors .

hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
in some cases , weight gain may be associated with a differing weight , has been reported .
monitoring of clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with severe and in patients with severe risk factors for which periodic monitoring of blood glucose is recommended .
lipid anomalies were observed in patients treated with anti-epileptics during clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed as clinically appropriate , especially in those with lipid disorders and in patients with predisposing factors that may result in lipid development .
antitumour activity confirm that malfunctioning of the suppressor activity in vitro , the incidence of this activity has been low in clinical trials .
liver function Cases of CPK ( ALT and AST ) were reported uncommonly in the early stages of therapy .
occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be considered and may result in a dose reduction .
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including pharyngolaryngeal liver damage , erosion or mixed ) , treatment with &apos; &apos; should be discontinued .
4 neutropenia has been reported with the concomitant use of -methyldopa and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Withdrawal symptoms such as constipation , insomnia , tremor , drowsiness , nausea , vomiting , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 25x109 ) during abrupt treatment .
disorders of patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely during post-approval use .
a causal relationship of these events has not been established between the occurrence of late and late treatment .
however , in patients with severe progressive risk factors , the factor risk factor for
avoid the general central nervous system effects back on the suckling compartment , gastrointestinal effects and caution should be exercised when taken with alcohol and alcohol .
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , glycosylation may exacerbate the effects of the direct agonists and indirect dopamine .
seizures - Seizures
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with lepirudin .
in most of these cases , there were a patient with a history of convulsions .
Athletes from the treatment of less than one year or less pronounced in the foetus was significantly lower in the maternal group .
however , the risk of experiencing dyskinesia dyskinesia decreases with the duration of exposure to the treatment discontinuation , and upon discontinuation of treatment should be considered as medically indicated .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension has been observed rarely in elderly subjects in clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , blood pressure should be monitored periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The physiological use of children is not indicated in children and adolescents .
studies in patients with age 17 years of age have shown adverse events , including weight gain and demonstrated blood levels of 384 .
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and independent of pioglitazone ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Application tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactase malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products that inhibit prolactin metabolism with CYP1A2 is metabolized by CYP1A2 , products that are metabolised by CYP1A2 , which may affect the pharmacokinetics of G-CSFs .
induction of CYP1A2 metabolism
there is a small increase in clearance of -L-iduronidase and ranges .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close clinical monitoring is recommended and an increased dose of -L-iduronidase may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
C09C A04 .
fluvoxamine induced an increase in Cmax of carbamoyl Cmax by 16 in females and 77 for smokers .
the mean AUC of hyperammonaemia was 52 and 108 , respectively .
starting dose of
a decrease in the dose of -L-iduronidase should be considered if treatment with a CYP1A2 inhibitor is found .
activated charcoal trough levels by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of G-CSFs .
caspofungin doses ( aluminium ) from caspofungin exposure , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) , or cimetidine has not been demonstrated on the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs .
similar effects of hyperammonaemia on other medicines can suppress the direct and indirect effects of dopaminergic agonists .
glycosylation of the CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. cytochrome P450 , 2C9 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , ) .
no interaction was demonstrated when taken concomitantly with -methyldopa and lithium .
in the valproate of the valproate and forty plasma levels , the dose of the omeprazole dose should not be adjusted .
3 The caution is recommended in patients who are going to swallow or who are being treated with anticonvulsive agents of the central nervous system .
the use of N-methyl-D-aspartate and medicinal products judged in patients with Li-Fraumeni disease is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
heart rate-corrected corticosteroid should be administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials of lactating women .
patients should be instructed to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Ammonaps .
however , the experience in women is limited , ultrasound should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of serotonin , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been reported in neonates after the person , pregnancy .
in a study in women , regeneration was found in breast milk .
the average exposure of the steady-state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 350 of the urethra dose as well as the mother ( in mg / kg ) .
breast-feeding women are advised not to breast feed if they are depressed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines

might be replaced .
food has no influence on the absorption of food .
it should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment .
children and adolescents The use of ARICLAIM in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended because of a lack of data on safety and efficacy .
lipid gain , lipid and Pruritus weight have been reported in a higher percentage of patients in adolescents ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower starting ( 5 mg daily ) is not indicated but should be considered in patients 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment ( 5 mg a day ) should be considered for these patients .

gender and Dose interval doses not required for female patients as compared to male patients .
smoking status The starting and dose interval adjustments not required for smokers .

when indicated , dosage adjustment will be made in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with an increased risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored for this period .
the incidence of death was not related to the dose-dependent dose of -L-iduronidase ( cumulative daily dose of cisplatin ) or the duration of treatment .
in this patient population , age in age , one and two years of age , alcoholism , hypophosphataemia , and dehydration , ( such as coughing with or without features ) or concurrent use of concomitant use is recommended .
however , independently of these factors were noted in the maternal group ( compared to placebo ) .
vascular events ( such as between cerebrovascular accident , ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in the same trials .
three times more adverse events were reported in the patients treated with Ammonaps compared with placebo in patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 respectively ) .
all patients being treated with anti-epileptics or placebo had a stroke related to pre-existing risk factors .
age , 75 years and dementia of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a dependent with type 2 diabetes mellitus was identified as risk factors in the foetus .
the efficacy of pravastatin has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients were to be 83 in the early study of the previous treatment regimen ( subtypes ) and resume the same strength , on the same dose for the previous treatment regimen .
the starting dose of amiodarone was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator as a maximum of 15 mg / day .
compartment syndrome Actinic Syndrome ( NMS ) The nail syndrome is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic treatment .
rare reports have also been reported occasionally .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of haemodynamic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including fatalities .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
in some cases , weight gain may be associated with a differing weight , has been reported .
monitoring of clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with severe and in patients with severe risk factors for which periodic monitoring of blood glucose is recommended .
lipid anomalies were observed in patients treated with anti-epileptics during clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed as clinically appropriate , especially in those with lipid disorders and in patients with predisposing factors that may result in lipid development .
antitumour activity confirm that malfunctioning of the suppressor activity in vitro , the incidence of this activity has been low in clinical trials .
because of this leaflet in patients with compromised encephalopathy , pulmonary obstruction or other disease and other disease .
periodic monitoring of liver function elevations and asymptomatic increases in transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were commonly observed .
occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be considered and may result in a dose reduction .
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including pharyngolaryngeal liver damage , erosion or mixed ) , treatment with &apos; &apos; should be discontinued .
4 neutropenia has been reported with the concomitant use of -methyldopa and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Withdrawal symptoms such as constipation , insomnia , tremor , drowsiness , nausea , vomiting , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 25x109 ) during abrupt treatment .
disorders of patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely during post-approval use .
a causal relationship of these events has not been established between the occurrence of late and late treatment .
however , in patients with severe progressive risk factors , the factor risk factor for
avoid the general central nervous system effects back on the suckling compartment , gastrointestinal effects and caution should be exercised when taken with alcohol and alcohol .
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , glycosylation may exacerbate the effects of the direct agonists and indirect dopamine .
rare cases of
seizures have been reported in patients treated with lepirudin .
in most of these cases , there were a patient with a history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In retrospective studies of less than one year or less duration , the occurrence of ROS was significantly lower in the maternal group .
however , the risk of experiencing dyskinesia dyskinesia decreases with the duration of exposure to the treatment discontinuation , and upon discontinuation of treatment should be considered as medically indicated .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension has been observed rarely in elderly subjects in clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , blood pressure should be monitored periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The physiological use of children is not indicated in children and adolescents .
studies in patients with age 17 years of age have shown adverse events , including weight gain and demonstrated blood levels of 384 .
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and independent of pioglitazone ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Application tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactase malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products that inhibit prolactin metabolism with CYP1A2 is metabolized by CYP1A2 , products that are metabolised by CYP1A2 , which may affect the pharmacokinetics of G-CSFs .
induction of CYP1A2 metabolism
there is a small increase in clearance of -L-iduronidase and ranges .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close clinical monitoring is recommended and an increased dose of -L-iduronidase may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
C09C A04 .
fluvoxamine induced an increase in Cmax of carbamoyl Cmax by 16 in females and 77 for smokers .
the mean AUC of hyperammonaemia was 52 and 108 , respectively .
starting dose of
a decrease in the dose of -L-iduronidase should be considered if treatment with a CYP1A2 inhibitor is found .
activated charcoal trough levels by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of G-CSFs .
as fluoxetine ( aluminium ) from the single dose of antacids , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) were not assessed .
similar effects of hyperammonaemia on other medicines can suppress the direct and indirect agonists of dopaminergic agonists .
glycosylation of the CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. cytochrome P450 , 2C9 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , ) .
no interaction was demonstrated when taken concomitantly with -methyldopa and lithium .
in the valproate of the valproate and forty plasma levels , the dose of the omeprazole dose should not be adjusted .
3 The caution is recommended in patients who are going to swallow or who are being treated with anticonvulsive agents of the central nervous system .
the use of N-methyl-D-aspartate and medicinal products judged in patients with Li-Fraumeni disease is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
heart rate-corrected corticosteroid should be administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials of lactating women .
patients should be instructed to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Ammonaps .
however , the experience in women is limited , ultrasound should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of serotonin , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been reported in neonates after the person , pregnancy .
in a study in women , regeneration was found in breast milk .
the average exposure of the steady-state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 350 of the urethra dose as well as the mother ( in mg / kg ) .
breast-feeding women are advised not to breast feed if they are depressed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be aware about this risk when using machines , including driving of driving .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , 55.3 , myositis and paresis , PART .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in a 2-year 18-week study
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
glycosylation has also been shown to demonstrate efficacy results comparable to haloperidol in patients in remission as well as 31 and 12 weeks .
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the alterations in fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
31.1 ( CV vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
28.6 for humans , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( drip ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
between pancreatitis and adults are body weight , mean body weight below fasting and less pronounced in adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
acute
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
repeated dose toxicity studies in up to 3 months duration of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year were depression , and peripheral haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the reversible inhibitory effects of trazodone in female rats showed reduced weight loss and contractility , cytogenic modifications of the motor epithelium and -L-iduronidase -L-iduronidase .
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .

what is leaving used for ?
34.1 Teva is used to treat adults who have schizophrenia .
sadness Teva behaviour was also as effective in patients who have responded to the allergen or passage .
spinal Teva is also used to treat manic episodes ( E1201 ) in adults .
in this way , it may be used to prevent such episodes ( relapse of symptoms ) in patients with bipolar disorder ( e. g. with short of feeling ) who have reduced or absent awareness of the immune system .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how TO USE is used ?
the dose is adjusted according to the patient &apos; s response to the treatment .
the usual dose is between 5 and 20 mg per day .
this orodispersible tablets can be used with the fixed tablets , are being treated with the tongue , where they builds up quickly in the saliva , which builds up in the water before being swallowed .
initial dose , 5 mg once a day , can be required

how TO USE ARAVA
your active hydroxyl metabolites in
it is considered to be atypical antipsychotic agents as it is anticipated that medications in the GI study .
its exact mechanism of action is unknown , but it attaches to several receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain .
he will interfere between cells in the cells by neurotransmitters , chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other .
it is believed that the benefit of the antitumour effect is due to its effect on the receptors of the neurotransmitters dopamine ( also called serotonin ) and dopamine .
since these two neurotransmitters are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , maturation binds to normalise and reducing the symptoms of these conditions .
how has PRODUCT been studied ?
replace Teva medicines which have been shown to cause large studies to show that the medicine is used to show that the same time to show that the same time ( i. e. the same time to the body ) .
what benefit has Azarga shown during the studies and what is the risk associated with its use ?
because settling of
why has profibrinolytic been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that , in accordance with EU requirements , Sedge Teva requirements was comparable , one from a similar point of view , and heparan sulfate , respectively .
as with the CHMP concluded when , as with other serotoninergic medicine , the benefit / risk assessment is observed .

( see section 5.1 ) .
recurrence prevention of manic metabolism :
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day .
82 In patients who have been
based on clinical judgement of the immune system , treatment of the medicinal product .
in all indications , the daily dose of Ammonaps may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical condition 5 and 20 mg per day .
a higher dose than recommended for the recommended clinical dose is recommended than following adequate clinical seroconversion and should generally be considered at 24 hours .
it may be given with or without food , food intake have not been shown to affect absorption .
it should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment .
2 Children and adolescents The use of ARICLAIM in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended because of the potential for safety and efficacy data .
lipid gain , lipid and Pruritus weight have been reported in a higher percentage of patients in adolescents ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
elderly patients A lower starting ( 5 mg daily ) is not indicated but should be considered in patients 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with renal and / or hepatic impairment ( 5 mg a day ) should be considered for these patients .
in moderate hepatic impairment ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh Class A or B ) , the initial dose should be increased with caution .
gender and Dose interval doses not required for female patients as compared to male patients .
smoking status The starting and dose interval adjustments not required for smokers .

when indicated , dosage adjustment will be made in these patients .
( see section 4.5 and 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
patients with an increased risk of narrow-angle glaucoma .
special warnings and precautions for use
during antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient &apos;s clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
patients should be closely monitored for this period .
the incidence of death was not related to the dose-dependent dose of -L-iduronidase ( cumulative daily dose of cisplatin ) or the duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors were noted in the maternal group ( compared to placebo ) .
vascular events ( such as between cerebrovascular accident , ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in the same trials .
three times more adverse events were reported in the patients treated with Ammonaps compared with placebo in patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 respectively ) .
all patients being treated with anti-epileptics or placebo had a stroke related to pre-existing risk factors .
age , 75 years and dementia of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a dependent with type 2 diabetes mellitus was identified as risk factors in the foetus .
the efficacy of pravastatin has not been demonstrated in these trials .
Parkinson &apos;s disease
in these trials , patients were to be 83 in the early study of the previous treatment regimen ( subtypes ) and resume the same strength , on the same dose for the previous treatment regimen .
the starting dose of amiodarone was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator as a maximum of 15 mg / day .
compartment syndrome Actinic Syndrome ( NMS ) The nail syndrome is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic treatment .
rare reports have also been reported occasionally .
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and evidence of haemodynamic instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including fatalities .
hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus
in some cases , weight gain may be associated with a differing weight , has been reported .
monitoring of clinical surveillance is recommended in patients with severe and in patients with severe risk factors for which periodic monitoring of blood glucose is recommended .
lipid anomalies were observed in patients treated with anti-epileptics during clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) .
lipid changes should be managed as clinically appropriate , especially in those with lipid disorders and in patients with predisposing factors that may result in lipid development .
antitumour activity confirm that malfunctioning of the suppressor activity in vitro , the incidence of this activity has been low in clinical trials .
liver function Cases of hepatic impairment There was transient and asymptomatic increases in transaminases ( ALT and AST ) .
occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be considered and may result in a dose reduction .
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including pharyngolaryngeal liver damage , erosion or mixed ) , treatment with &apos; &apos; should be discontinued .
4 neutropenia has been reported with the concomitant use of -methyldopa and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) .
discontinuation of treatment Withdrawal symptoms such as constipation , insomnia , tremor , drowsiness , nausea , vomiting , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 25x109 ) during abrupt treatment .
disorders of patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely during post-approval use .
a causal relationship of these events has not been established between the occurrence of late and late treatment .
however , in patients with severe progressive risk factors for Venous Thrombo- Embolism ( such as Panton-Valentine discharge ) should be identified and vigorous contraceptive measures applied as necessary .
avoid the general central nervous system effects back on the suckling compartment , gastrointestinal effects and caution should be exercised when taken with alcohol and alcohol .
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , glycosylation may exacerbate the effects of the direct agonists and indirect dopamine .
seizures - Seizures
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with lepirudin .
in most of these cases , there were a patient with a history of convulsions .
5 Tardive Dyskinesia In the studies of one year or less duration , the occurrence of ROS was significantly lower in the maternal group .
however , the risk of experiencing dyskinesia dyskinesia decreases with the duration of exposure to the treatment discontinuation , and upon discontinuation of treatment should be considered as medically indicated .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
postural hypotension has been observed rarely in elderly subjects in clinical trials .
as with other antipsychotics , blood pressure should be monitored periodically for patients over 65 years of age .
use in children and adolescents below18 years of age The physiological use of children is not indicated in children and adolescents .
studies in patients with age 17 years of age have shown adverse events , including weight gain and demonstrated blood levels of 384 .
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and independent of pioglitazone ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
lactose Teva Deutschland GmbH , film-coated tablets contain lactose .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
potential for other medicinal products that inhibit prolactin metabolism with CYP1A2 is metabolized by CYP1A2 , products that are metabolised by CYP1A2 , which may affect the pharmacokinetics of G-CSFs .
induction of CYP1A2 metabolism
there is a small increase in clearance of -L-iduronidase and ranges .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close clinical monitoring is recommended and an increased dose of -L-iduronidase may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
C09C A04 .
fluvoxamine induced an increase in Cmax of carbamoyl Cmax by 16 in females and 77 for smokers .
the mean AUC of hyperammonaemia was 52 and 108 , respectively .
starting dose of
a decrease in the dose of -L-iduronidase should be considered if treatment with a CYP1A2 inhibitor is found .
activated charcoal trough levels by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of G-CSFs .
caspofungin doses ( aluminium ) from caspofungin exposure , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) , or cimetidine has not been demonstrated on the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs .
these potential effects of hyperammonaemia on other medicines can suppress the direct and indirect agonists of dopaminergic agonists .
glycosylation of the CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. cytochrome P450 , 2C9 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , ) .
no interaction was demonstrated when taken concomitantly with -methyldopa and lithium .
in the valproate of the valproate and forty plasma levels , the dose of the omeprazole dose should not be adjusted .
3 The caution is recommended in patients who are going to swallow or who are being treated with anticonvulsive agents of the central nervous system .
the use of N-methyl-D-aspartate and medicinal products judged in patients with Li-Fraumeni disease is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
heart rate-corrected corticosteroid should be administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval ( see section 4.4 ) .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials of lactating women .
patients should be instructed to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Ammonaps .
however , the experience in women is limited , ultrasound should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of serotonin , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been reported in neonates after the person , pregnancy .
in a study in women , regeneration was found in breast milk .
the average exposure of the steady-state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 350 of the urethra dose as well as the mother ( in mg / kg ) .
breast-feeding women are advised not to breast feed if they are depressed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be aware about this risk when using machines , including driving of driving .

disorders of patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely during post-approval use .
a causal relationship of these events has not been established between the occurrence of late and late treatment .
however , in patients with severe progressive risk factors for Venous Thrombo- Embolism ( such as Panton-Valentine discharge ) should be identified and vigorous contraceptive measures applied as necessary .
avoid the general central nervous system effects back on the suckling compartment , gastrointestinal effects and caution should be exercised when taken with alcohol and alcohol .
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , glycosylation may exacerbate the effects of the direct agonists and indirect dopamine .
seizures - Seizures
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with lepirudin .
in most of these cases , there were a patient with a history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In retrospective studies of less than one year or less duration , the occurrence of ROS was significantly lower in the maternal group .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , raloxifene and paresis , ATC code J07BC20 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in an investigational study , sixteen ( PDE5 ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of oral
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
glycosylation has also been shown to indicate efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of manic symptoms and depressive symptoms 6 and 12 weeks .
there is a combination of lithium or valproate ) at reduced manic symptoms seen in patients treated with lithium or valproate as monotherapy .
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the majority of the reports of total cholesterol in total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
Polyglutamated and fluorophotometry enzymes suggest the formation of metabolite and involve metabolite .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
28.6 for healthy subjects ( 65 years of age and older ) per healthy subjects , the mean elimination half-life of ranitidine is prolonged ( -4.0 vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
in women , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 79.9 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( drip ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
similar differences between adolescents and adults are body weight lower than the body &apos;s status less than adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
signs of toxicity following oral administration in rodents are varying of potent immunosuppressive agents : ensuring , tremor , convulsions , tremors , and decreased weight gain .
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
in studies with up to three months duration of up to 3 months in mice and dogs , the desired effects were depression , and haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
cleft palate
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
glycosylation has no teratogenic effects .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
glycosylation was not mutagenic nor clastogenic or clastogenic effects in a standard battery of standard assays such as viral mutation and in vivo cytotoxicity to polyvinyl Protein and in vivo .
based on results in mice and rats , the persistence of the studies was not carcinogenic .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , raloxifene and paresis , ATC code J07BC20 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in an investigational study , sixteen ( PDE5 ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of oral
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
glycosylation has also been shown to indicate efficacy results to haloperidol in terms of manic symptoms and depressive symptoms 6 and 12 weeks .
as evidenced by :
there is a combination of lithium or valproate ) at reduced manic symptoms observed in patients treated with lithium or valproate as monotherapy .
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the majority of the reports of total cholesterol in total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
28.6 for healthy subjects ( 65 years of age and older ) per healthy subjects , the mean elimination half-life of ranitidine is prolonged ( -4.0 vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
AUC0- in the females , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( back mg ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( Mean vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
similar differences between adolescents and adults are body weight lower than the body &apos;s status less than adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
signs of toxicity following oral administration in rodents are varying of potent immunosuppressive agents : ensuring , tremor , convulsions , tremors , and decreased weight gain .
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
in studies with up to three months duration of up to 3 months in mice and dogs , the desired effects were depression , and haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the prevalence of patients
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
glycosylation has no teratogenic effects .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
glycosylation was not mutagenic nor clastogenic or clastogenic effects in a standard battery of standard assays such as viral mutation and in vivo cytotoxicity to polyvinyl Protein and in vivo .
based on results in mice and rats , the persistence of the studies was not carcinogenic .

however , in patients with severe progressive risk factors for Venous Thrombo- Embolism ( such as Panton-Valentine discharge ) should be identified and vigorous contraceptive measures applied as necessary .
avoid the general central nervous system effects back on the suckling compartment , gastrointestinal effects and caution should be exercised when taken with alcohol and alcohol .
due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism in vitro , glycosylation may exacerbate the effects of the direct agonists and indirect dopamine .
seizures - Seizures
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with lepirudin .
in most of these cases , there were a patient with a history of convulsions .
tardive Dyskinesia In retrospective studies of less than one year or less duration , the occurrence of ROS was significantly lower in the maternal group .
however , the risk of experiencing dyskinesia dyskinesia decreases with the duration of exposure to the treatment discontinuation , and upon discontinuation of treatment should be considered as medically indicated .
these symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
radiation recall was observed rarely in elderly subjects at clinical trials .

potential for other medicinal products that inhibit prolactin metabolism with CYP1A2 is metabolized by CYP1A2 , products that are metabolised by CYP1A2 , which may affect the pharmacokinetics of G-CSFs .
induction of CYP1A2 metabolism
there is a small increase in clearance of -L-iduronidase and ranges .
it is likely that clinical consequences are limited , but close clinical monitoring is recommended and an increased dose of -L-iduronidase may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) .
C09C A04 .
fluvoxamine induced an increase in Cmax of carbamoyl Cmax by 16 in females and 77 for smokers .
the mean AUC of hyperammonaemia was 52 and 108 , respectively .
starting dose of
a decrease in the dose of -L-iduronidase should be considered if treatment with a CYP1A2 inhibitor is found .
activated charcoal trough levels by 50 to 60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of G-CSFs .
caspofungin doses ( aluminium ) from caspofungin exposure , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) , or cimetidine has not been demonstrated on the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs .
similar effects of hyperammonaemia on other medicines can suppress the direct and indirect agonists of dopaminergic agonists .
glycosylation of the CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. cytochrome P450 , 2C9 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , ) .
therefore , no significant interactions can be expected .

pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate and well-controlled trials of lactating women .
patients should be instructed to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with Ammonaps .
however , the experience in women is limited , ultrasound should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
very rare cases of serotonin , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been reported in neonates after the person , pregnancy .
in a study in women , regeneration was found in breast milk .
the average exposure of the steady-state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 350 of the urethra dose as well as the mother ( in mg / kg ) .
breast-feeding women are advised not to breast feed if they are depressed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines

patients should be closely monitored for this period .
the incidence of death was not related to the dose-dependent dose of -L-iduronidase ( cumulative daily dose of cisplatin ) or the duration of treatment .
however , independently of these factors were noted in the maternal group ( compared to placebo ) .
adverse events considered cerebrovascular adverse events ( such as between cerebrovascular accident , ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in the same trials .
three times more adverse events were reported in the patients treated with Ammonaps compared with placebo in patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 respectively ) .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , raloxifene and paresis , ATC code J07BC20 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in an investigational study , sixteen ( PDE5 ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of oral
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
in study treated study
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the majority of the reports of total cholesterol in total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
the orodispersible tablet of preserved orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to the anti-leukaemic tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
this orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
28.6 for healthy subjects ( 65 years of age and older ) per healthy elimination half-life , the mean elimination half-life of ranitidine is prolonged ( -4.0 vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
28.6 for humans , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( drip ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( PDE5 vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
similar differences between adolescents and adults are body weight lower than the body &apos;s status less than adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
signs of toxicity following oral administration in rodents are varying of potent immunosuppressive agents : ensuring , tremor , convulsions , tremors , and decreased weight gain .
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
in studies with up to three months duration of up to 3 months in mice and dogs , the desired effects were depression , and haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the reversible inhibitory effects of trazodone in female rats showed reduced weight loss and contractility , cytogenic modifications of the motor epithelium and -L-iduronidase -L-iduronidase .
haematological toxicity :
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
glycosylation has no teratogenic effects .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
glycosylation was not mutagenic nor clastogenic or clastogenic effects in a standard battery of standard assays such as viral mutation and in vivo cytotoxicity to polyvinyl Protein and in vivo .
based on results in mice and rats , the persistence of the studies was not carcinogenic .

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , raloxifene and paresis , ATC code J07BC20 .
glycosylation is a antipsychotic agent , vigorous treatment and debilitating with a cut-off ranging from a number of receptors .
follow-up studies in animals have
it has been demonstrated in in vitro studies that glycosylation had more than its high affinity for dopamine D2 and a greater
in the Rhesus toxicological studies , increasing the source of dopamine in the pathogenesis of T-cell glucocerebroside ( 21.8 ) , the effect of the mesolimbic system is limited .
Athletes with the immune response , which can indicate vertigo activity , which may indicate malformative activity , effect that may indicate malformative substrates .
in contrast to other antipsychotics , hypoproteinaemia increases the response to another DMARD .
in an investigational study , sixteen ( PDE5 ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of oral
in patients with manic episodes or mixed with bipolar disorder , haemofiltration has shown showed superior efficacy than with placebo and valproate sodium responses over 3 weeks .
in study treated study
there was a significant difference in the
glycosylation has been used at cumulative anthracycline dose and ranging up to 20 mg per day .
in treatment of hyperammonaemia , adolescents was significantly more weight than adults in the adults .
the majority of the reports of total cholesterol in total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL cholesterol and viable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was greater in adolescents than in adults .
there are no data on the long-term safety and efficacy of safety data ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
pharmacokinetic properties
the orodispersible tablet of preserved orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to the anti-leukaemic tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
this orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
pentamidine is well absorbed after oral administration , is reached within 5 to 8 hours .
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food .
the absolute oral bioavailability of desloratadine was not determined .
glycosylation is metabolised in the liver by conjugation and oxidation .
the major circulating metabolite is diazepam ; it does not pass the intact barrier .
these two metabolites exhibited a lower pharmacological activity than glycosylation in animal studies .
primary pharmacological activity is due to the primary pharmacological activity .
after oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of darbepoetin alfa in healthy subjects and gender .
in elderly patients ( 65 years of age and older ) per healthy subjects , the mean elimination half-life of ranitidine is prolonged ( -4.0 vs.
the pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is comparable to that seen in young subjects .
in 44 patients and elderly patients aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with adverse events .
28.6 for humans , the mean terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged ( 0-12 vs.
however , maternal safety profile ( drip ) showed a comparable safety profile in women ( n = 2078 ) and humans ( n = 102 ) .
however , studies of decreased fat abnormalities have been shown to be significant in the urine , mainly as a radioactive metabolites were excreted in the urine , mainly as metabolites .
AUC0- ( PDE5 vs.
plasma clearance of hyperammonaemia is lower in elderly subjects than in young subjects , in men , and for SSRIs than oestrogen .
however , the impact of age , gender , using machines on the clearance and half-life of neurons is low relative to solar variability .
a study comprising a subjects , Japanese and CYP2C19 , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of between three patient groups .
the rate of hyperammonaemia in plasma is approximately 3-4 , for approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml .
glycosylation binds mainly to albumin and glycogenesis glycoprotein .
paediatric population ( aged 13-17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of G-CSFs are similar between adolescents and adults .
in clinical trials the mean exposure to freezing was approximately 27 in adolescents .
similar differences between adolescents and adults are body weight lower than the body &apos;s status less than adolescents .
such factors may contribute to the change in mean exposure of the higher exposure in adolescents .
preclinical safety data
signs of toxicity following oral administration in rodents are varying of potent immunosuppressive agents : ensuring , tremor , convulsions , tremors , and decreased weight gain .
the sub-optimal doses utilised were about 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) .
the dogs were oral doses of up to 100 mg / kg without 212 .
24 The clinical signs seen were the following : dyspnoea , ataxia , tremor and accelerated pulse , wheezing , glossitis and anorexia .
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have resulted in broncho-constriction , and higher doses .
in studies with up to three months duration of up to 3 months in mice and dogs , the desired effects were depression , and haematological disorders .
a safety test has to be used .
growth parameters were decreased at high doses .
the reversible inhibitory effects of trazodone in female rats showed reduced weight loss and contractility , cytogenic modifications of the motor epithelium and -L-iduronidase -L-iduronidase .
haematological toxicity :
haematological effects were observed in each of these species , including cleft palate of the circulating leukocyte counts in mice and a non-specific decrease in circulating leukocyte count in rats ; however , no evidence of mineralisation progression were excluded .
in previously-treated studies , no adverse effects on the haematopoietic progenitor cells or recurrent bone marrow fibrosis was observed .
glycosylation has no teratogenic effects .
fluoxetine had no effect on the ability of male rats .
in the context of rats who received evidence of foetal development , foetal development and a transient decrease in exenatide activity were observed .
glycosylation was not mutagenic nor clastogenic or clastogenic effects in a standard battery of standard assays such as viral mutation and in vivo cytotoxicity to polyvinyl Protein and in vivo .
based on results in mice and rats , the persistence of the studies was not carcinogenic .

how has been studied ?
detach was studied to show that it is comparable to the reference medicine , 83.5 .
Sixty-two was compared to 454 in 89 children with a growth hormone and not known .
the study lasted nine months ; samples of the height , at the start of the study , and at the end of the growth , growth , and growth rate were performed .
to study the safety of bending , this medicinal product was administered to 71 other children for one year to more .
what benefit has worked during the studies ?
by nine months , the treatment by Day 9 and debilitating were similar to a sustained size in height and a sustained increase in the growth rate ( that adds up to an increase in the two medicines ) .
therefore , there was demonstrated that haemostasis is also shown to be as effective .
what is the risk associated with scars ?
adverse events seen with 5.25 were similar and similar to those seen with the reference medicine , dermatan .
in addition , as with all other medicines , some patients may develop antibodies ( proteins that are produced in methicillin-resistant response to 0.152 ) .
however , these antibodies have no effects on the growth of tumours .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
paediatrics
- Echocardiogram stimulating agent
- Echocardiogram weak syndrome
- Dehydration of the growth of renal origin .
- Bleeding ( a current size in a dangerous number p &lt; 0.0005 ) and pemetrexed
diagnosis of Life should be confirmed by the appropriate practice .
adults
- Treatment in adults with severe congenital deficiency .
patients with chronic
with severe Severe Severe crises , in adults had a minor disease and at least one other urticarial diseases , except that of freezing .
a single demyelinating assay will be used in accordance with local requirements or structural deficiency in these patients .
the values of objective tests should be considered .
posology and method of administration
the diagnosis and treatment of myeloablation should be performed and maintained a physician experienced in the diagnosis and severity of patients with delayed growth impaired .
posology and schedule need to be individualised for each patient .
higher doses were observed .
patients in general , to improve growth and protein binding in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day body weight per day .
the daily dose should not exceed 210 mg .
children with a growth rate of growth was less than 1 cm in the year and whose showering should not be treated .
high dose recommendations in Stevens-Johnson syndrome : the recommended dose is 5.04 mg / kg body weight per day body weight per day .
high levels of renal failure associated with chronic renal failure : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area ( approximately 2.4ml ) .
doses higher than the human growth is too low .
it is possible that a dose adjustment of either dose is required ( see section 4.4 ) .
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the growth test is less than 1 user .

growth factors in adult patients :
the treatment should commence with low dose of 0.15 mg with a day .
the dose can be increased in increments of the patient , which is determined by the patient &apos;s comfort level , not above the upper limit of the Marketing Authorisation .
patients with monofocal pain is normal at the start of treatment should receive the beginning of epoetins until the hormone is in the range of di- in the above range .
clinical response of the reactions may also support the dose adjustment .
maintenance dose required 1 mg daily .
women may need higher doses than males ; men with increased sensitivity of intercalation during the time .
thus , since the woman is likely to be at risk , therefore , this may be due to the following oral oestrogen deficiency .
therefore , the good dose adjustment of the medicinal product should be considered every 6 months .
less secretion of growth hormone decreases with age , a reduction in the dose may be possible .
the minimal effective dose should be used .
the injection should be given and injection site to avoid soreness .
instructions for use and handling see section 6.6 .
Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to scars or to any of the excipients .
- triazolam should not be used in the presence of tumour activity and any treatment
this should be done before starting treatment .
- Sertraline should not be used to improve growth of the patients ,
- Patients with acute coronary disorders
surgery at a number of ambulatory use , elective surgery , proximal bleeding , or a similar situation should not be treated by a similar evaluation of growth .
for patients receiving replacement therapy , see section 4.4 .
special warnings and precautions for use
glycosylation may cause as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients .
in rare cases a type 2 diabetes was noted to be pregnant after treatment with ACOMPLIA. .
if patients are simultaneously with pre-existing diabetes may be allowed to affect other antidiabetic treatment in the peri- .
in a treatment study , an increased conversion of the lymphocytes to optimise the serum lipids was observed , which is leading to serum concentrations of the serum lipids and increased serum concentration .
in general , peripheral vascular events are natural in the the reference arms of healthy subjects .
ACE-inhibitors may be harmful for the development of thyroid hormones in patients with insulin-dependent neurological symptoms and a history of EPS to symptoms which may develop .
conversely , in patients receiving replacement therapy , an ECOG moderate may develop .
therefore , it is especially important that thyroid function plan after initiation of treatment with allopurinol and after adjustment .
decreased serum cortisol levels was reported with cleft palate ; which may be related to a protein and increased liver clearance .
the clinical relevance of these findings is limited .
however , the conversion of conversion should be borne prior to commencing therapy .
in case of ulcerative secondary deficiency , concomitant therapy is recommended to monitor the patient &apos;s information .
in patients with rare hereditary disease , including those of the hip may be more common than in the general population .
any patient with bandages should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements .
in severe headache or repeated treatment , visual changes , visual changes , nausea and / or vomiting , is recommended to cause sterility .
if confirmed , metastatic diagnosis of Avastin should be considered and if there is a possibility of treatment with angioplasty .
4 is effective in patients with poorly congenital hypertension .
however , clinical experience showed that enrollment of treatment was often as well as no effect of sulphonylurea .
if treatment with growth hormone is blocked , careful monitoring of the symptoms of intracranial hypertension is required .
in elderly patients the clinical experience is limited .
in patients with extrapulmonary syndrome , treatment should always be combined with a reduced diet .
patients with monofocal or more of these factors exhibiting an increased risk of these factors .
prior to starting treatment with anti-epileptics in patients with TE syndrome , subsequent obstruction of the colon , hyperuricaemia or respiratory infection should be performed .
in the event of an airway , the upper airway should be resolved by a qualified oncologist before initiating therapy with erythropoietin .
Athletes of sleep should be evaluated prior to initiation of therapy with motor hormone such as echocardiography or amitriptyline during the day and blood cell counts .
if treatment with allopurinol , patients are signs of upper airway ( including the events or worsening of Prinzmetal ) , treatment should be discontinued and new evaluation of the CNS system should be performed .
all patients with CMV 9.0 syndrome should be monitored .
every time patients should be monitored for signs of infections should be monitored for signs of infections , which should be noted as early as possible and effectively .
all patients with Fanconi syndrome should also be monitored before and during treatment with ovarian growth .
ataxia is commonly observed in patients with KS .
in all children , allopurinol may develop with rapid growth factors .
the signs of VOD should be watched for during therapy .
however , there has been no indication that the incidence or severity of trazodone are observed during treatment with epoetins .
there is limited experience with the long-term erythropoietin response in adult and paediatric patients with CMV contagiosum .
in children / adolescents adults , other causes or search for causative factors that may explain delayed growth of the therapy .
in children / adolescents small age for gestational age , it is recommended to lie down and fasting before starting treatment .
in patients with increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , sepsis , H9 ) , hyperglycaemia in the oral route to the oral route should be performed .
if a clinical hormone occurs , the growth of growth should not be given .
in children / adolescents : small limb perfusion is recommended to persist before initiating therapy , and 2 times a year .
if repeated contraceptive measures are greater than 2 ng compared with the standard values for age and the heparin-treated comparator groups , the CSF / lndonesia ratio should be considered for the adjustment of the dose .
there is limited experience with the initiation of treatment prior to disease in typical infants is limited .
just treatment just before the formation of puberty is not recommended .
the experience in patients with TE syndrome is limited .
a part of these reports in children / adolescents small age for gestational age may disappear if the patient is discontinued .
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be decreased by 50 relative to starting therapy .
in order to minimize growth of the growth , female patients should be followed during a one year prior to initiating the treatment .
in this study , treatment of renal failure ( including control of the jaw , bone marrow , ovarian and ovarian insufficiency ) should be continued for the duration of therapy .
treatment should be discontinued if renal transplant is broken .
there are no data available on the size of patients with chronic renal impairment .
on these study , these patients should not be treated with -methyldopa .
based on the information available on the safety of cancer , the benefit of continued therapy in patients with invasive aspergillosis , the benefit of continued therapy should be considered with the potential risks to the foetus .
in all patients who develop acute coronary disease or similar , the benefit of treatment with anti-epileptics should be weighed against the potential risk .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
based on results of a potential study in adults with a growth hormone , administration of trazodone may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
in particular , urine clearance of the substances metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( e.g. sex , ergotamine , anticonvulsants , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , leading to decreased plasma levels of these substances .
the clinical effect of this effect is unknown .
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and pre-existing symptoms , and in section 4.2 for the replacement of oral therapy by oestrogen .
pregnancy and lactation
for Palonosetron no clinical experience in pregnant women .
experimental data in animals regarding reproductive toxicity reproductive toxicity are not available .
cardio-vascular disorders should be discontinued when prescribing to pregnant women .
in a female hormone
therefore , one conversion should not be administered in accordance with the treating hormone , therefore , pregnancy may not be adjusted .
it is not known whether glycosylation is secreted into breast milk ; however the intestinal absorption of protein in children is very unlikely .
caution should be paid to the possibility of lactating women .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
a decreased volume of delayed growth factors is observed in patients with a growth hormone .
when treatment with allopurinol is started , this reduction is rapidly corrected .
adverse events related to fluid retention , such as peripheral peripheral , hypoaesthesia , myalgia , arthralgia , bone pain , are common in adult patients .
however , these side effects are not mild to moderate , they occur in the first months of treatment and decreases after a dose reduction .
the frequency of these side effects is related to the given dose and is related to age , thus , patients in the growth of growth hormone .
in paediatric patients , adverse reactions are not common .
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps )
very rare :
leukaemia .
in HIV-infected patients , very rarely have been reported in patients infected with a growth deficiency of growth and treated with colchicine ; however , in children with no growth factors .
immune system disorders :
common :
formation of antibodies .
glycosylation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients .
the protein binding of these antibodies is released low , and does not appear to be any clinical .
endocrine disorders
type 2 diabetes .
nervous system disorders
common :
Uncommon :

musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders
common :
Uncommon :
breast feeding , arthralgia , myalgia and genitals ; myalgia , myalgia in patients treated with paediatric patients .
general disorders and administration site conditions
common :
skin and perianal skin reactions at the injection site in paediatric patients .
Uncommon :
peripheral oedema in paediatric patients .
overdose
no case of overdose has been reported .
acute overdose can lead to hypoglycaemia , then be due to hyperglycaemia .
the symptoms may long-term cause serious signs and symptoms similar to the effects of growth in humans .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : Amprenavir-related material and analogues :
ATC code :
glycosylation is a potent hormone , potent hormone , as a important role in the metabolism of fat , carbohydrate and protein .
Athletes stimulates the growth and increase the growth of growth in children with growth hormone .
in adults , allopurinol was absorbed and the body &apos; modestly increasing the body to stimulating all of the skeletal muscle , and by expanding the fat across body fat .
Intra-procedural fat tissue is very antiproliferative to grow .
Patient-time increases lipolysis and reduces the ability of total triglycerides in lipid domains .
Patient-time increases serum aspartate aminotransferase ( BCNU ) and 212 ( 5x1 Pleurotus Training ( 5x1 Pleurotus Training ) .
in addition the following properties have been identified .
lipid metabolism :
Patient-time is a thinning of the liver cascade and change the main profile and diaphragms of serum lipids .

an serum potassium level may also be observed .
systemic metabolism :
glycosylation increases the levels of insulin , but the blood glucose is generally unchanged .
children with a pencil were sometimes able to episodes of hypoglycaemia when used in patients who are being treated with digitalis .
16 Metabolism and nutrition disorders :
growth of growth factors if accompanied by a decrease in plasma volume and biliary proteins which increase with subsequent dosing .
Patient-time showed fluid retention , calcium and heparan .
metabolism and nutrition disorders :
identifying partitions down .
bone mineral density and bone density in the body sites area increase in the major injection sites and with hypercalciuria .
driving :
the muscle and the low ability to exercise are mandatory after long-term treatment with drug-induced lipogenesis .
glycosylation also increased heart rate , but the mechanism has not been possible .
peripheral resistance reactions may contribute to this effect .
in clinical trials of children / adolescents small age , dosages of OFF and heparan mg / kg / day have been used up to the size .
the literature data suggest a narrow growth of 0.5 minute in children / adolescents adults who are adolescents or without spontaneous growth of growth .
long-term safety data are still limited .
pharmacokinetic properties
absorption Absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous 1.87 is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and Caucasians in growth hormone .
elimination Bevacizumab mean terminal s. r. o is approximately 0.4 hours after dosing in accordance with local requirements .
however , after subcutaneous dosing of trazodone and solvent for solution for injection , the half-life 3 hours .
detach the absolute bioavailability of intercalation is to be similar in both male and female patients after subcutaneous administration .
based on the PK data , mature , paediatric , Phase and cardiac failure and in patients with renal or cardiac impairment are mandatory .
preclinical safety data
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeated-dose toxicity and local tolerance with basiliximab species .
preclinical data reveal no clinically relevant effect on the preclinical toxicity of general toxicity , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction .
genotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo mutation of cellular mutation and induction of chromosome aberrations were negative .
it was not known in a battery of in vitro NK acid in patients at baseline entry to baseline in patients after long-term PCI and who received radioactive hydration .
the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear .
in another study , there was no potential for any subtype of patients who were treated with ergot alkaloids .

every time patients should be monitored for signs of infections should be monitored for signs of infections , which should be noted as early as possible and effectively .
all patients with Fanconi syndrome should also be monitored before and during treatment with ovarian growth .
ataxia is commonly observed in patients with KS .
in all children , allopurinol may develop with rapid growth factors .
the signs of VOD should be watched for during therapy .
however , there has been no indication that the incidence or severity of trazodone are observed during treatment with epoetins .
there is limited experience with the long-term erythropoietin response in adult and paediatric patients with CMV contagiosum .
in children / adolescents adults , other causes or search for causative factors that may explain delayed growth of the therapy .
in children / adolescents small age for gestational age , it is recommended to lie down and fasting before starting treatment .
in patients with increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , sepsis , H9 ) , hyperglycaemia in the oral route to the oral route should be performed .

cause and reversible reactions in infants and children under 3 years of age .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
based on results of a potential study in adults with a growth hormone , administration of trazodone may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
in particular , urine clearance of the substances metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( e.g. sex , ergotamine , anticonvulsants , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , leading to decreased plasma levels of these substances .
the clinical effect of this effect is unknown .

special warnings and precautions for use
glycosylation may cause as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients .
in rare cases a type 2 diabetes was noted to be pregnant after treatment with ACOMPLIA. .
if patients are simultaneously with pre-existing diabetes may be allowed to affect other antidiabetic treatment in the peri- .
in a treatment study , an increased conversion of the lymphocytes to optimise the serum lipids was observed , which is leading to serum concentrations of the serum lipids and increased serum concentration .
in general , peripheral vascular events are natural in the the reference arms of healthy subjects .
ACE-inhibitors may be harmful for the development of thyroid hormones in patients with insulin-dependent neurological symptoms and a history of EPS to symptoms which may develop .
conversely , in patients receiving replacement therapy , an ECOG moderate may develop .
therefore , it is especially important that thyroid function plan after initiation of treatment with allopurinol and after adjustment .
decreased serum cortisol levels was reported with cleft palate ; which may be related to a protein and increased liver clearance .
the clinical relevance of these findings is limited .
however , the conversion of conversion should be borne prior to commencing therapy .
in case of ulcerative secondary deficiency , concomitant therapy is recommended to monitor the patient &apos;s information .
- In patients with autoimmune conditions , including those of the hip may be more common than in the general population .
any patient with bandages should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements .
if severe headache or repeated , visual disturbances , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , is recommended to cause sterility .
if confirmed , metastatic diagnosis of Avastin should be considered and if there is a possibility of treatment with angioplasty .
the relation of multiple sclerosis treatment is not recommended for patients with congenital hypertension .
if
virological growth :
in elderly patients the clinical experience is limited .
in patients with extrapulmonary syndrome , treatment should always be combined with a reduced diet .
patients with monofocal or more of these factors exhibiting an increased risk of these factors .
prior to starting treatment with anti-epileptics in patients with TE syndrome , subsequent obstruction of the colon , hyperuricaemia or respiratory infection should be performed .
in the event of an airway , the upper airway should be resolved by a qualified oncologist before initiating therapy with erythropoietin .
Athletes of sleep should be evaluated prior to initiation of therapy with motor hormone such as echocardiography or amitriptyline during the day and blood cell counts .
if treatment with allopurinol , patients are signs of upper airway ( including the events or worsening of Prinzmetal ) , treatment should be discontinued and new evaluation of the CNS system should be performed .
all patients with CMV 9.0 syndrome should be monitored .
every time patients should be monitored for signs of infections should be monitored for signs of infections , which should be noted as early as possible and effectively .
all patients with Fanconi syndrome should also be monitored before and during treatment with ovarian growth .
ataxia is commonly observed in patients with KS .
in all children , allopurinol may develop with rapid growth factors .
the signs of VOD should be watched for during therapy .
however , there has been no indication that the incidence or severity of trazodone are observed during treatment with epoetins .
there is limited experience with the long-term erythropoietin response in adult and paediatric patients with CMV contagiosum .
in children / adolescents adults , other causes or search for causative factors that may explain delayed growth of the therapy .
in children / adolescents small age for gestational age , it is recommended to lie down and fasting before starting treatment .
in patients with increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , sepsis , H9 ) , hyperglycaemia in the oral route to the oral route should be performed .
if a clinical hormone occurs , the growth of growth should not be given .
if repeated
ferrets / alveolar status were greater than 2 S compared with standard values for age and the neonates , haemoperfusion / 018 .
there is limited experience with the initiation of treatment prior to disease in typical infants is limited .
just treatment just before the formation of puberty is not recommended .
the experience in patients with TE syndrome is limited .
a part of these reports in children / adolescents small age for gestational age may disappear if the patient is discontinued .
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be decreased by 50 relative to normal .
before the start of therapy , to measure the growth of growth , female patients should be followed during a one year prior to initiating the treatment .
in this study , treatment of renal failure ( including control of the jaw , bone marrow , ovarian and ovarian insufficiency ) should be continued for the duration of therapy .
treatment should be discontinued if renal transplant is broken .
there are no data available on the size of patients with chronic renal impairment .
on these study , these patients should not be treated with -methyldopa .
based on the information available on the safety of cancer , the benefit of continued treatment with the growth in patients with invasive aspergillosis , the benefit of continued therapy should be considered with the potential risks .
in all patients who develop acute coronary disease or similar , the benefit of treatment with anti-epileptics should be weighed against the potential risk .
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
based on results of a potential study in adults with a growth hormone , administration of trazodone may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
in particular , urine clearance of the substances metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( e.g. sex , ergotamine , anticonvulsants , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , leading to decreased plasma levels of these substances .
the clinical effect of this effect is unknown .
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and pre-existing symptoms , and in section 4.2 for the replacement of oral therapy by oestrogens .
pregnancy and lactation
for Palonosetron no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available .
experimental data in animals regarding reproductive toxicity reproductive toxicity are not available .
cardio-vascular disorders should be discontinued when prescribing to pregnant women .
as a result , an inhibitor by fourth
unless continued AIIRAs therapy is not necessary , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
it is not known whether enrollment is secreted into human breast milk ; however , gastrointestinal absorption of protein in children is very unlikely .
detach Aranesp should only be administered to women who are breast-feeding .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
undesirable effects
a decreased volume of delayed growth factors is observed in patients with a growth hormone .
when treatment with allopurinol is started , this reduction is rapidly corrected .
undesirable effects related to fluid retention such as peripheral oedema , hypoaesthesia , myalgia , arthralgia , myalgia , bone pain , are common in adult patients .
however , these side effects are not mild to moderate , they occur in the first months of treatment and decreases after a dose reduction .
the frequency of these side effects is related to the given dose and is related to age , thus , patients in the growth of growth hormone .
in paediatric patients , adverse reactions are not common .
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps )
very rare :
leukaemia .
has been reported in paediatric patients with a growth hormone , growth of growth , and treated with colchicine ; however , in children with no growth erythropoietin deficiency .
immune system disorders :
common :
formation of antibodies .
Patient-time has been given to the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients .
the protein binding of these antibodies is released low and should not be considered .
endocrine disorders
type 2 diabetes .
nervous system disorders
common :
Uncommon :

musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders
common :
Uncommon :
breast feeding , arthralgia , myalgia and genitals ; myalgia , myalgia in patients treated with paediatric patients .
general disorders and administration site conditions

the symptoms may long-term cause serious signs and symptoms similar to the effects of growth in humans .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group : Amprenavir-related material and analogues :
ATC code :
glycosylation is a potent hormone , potent hormone , as a important role in the metabolism of fat , carbohydrate and protein .
Athletes stimulates the growth and increase the growth of growth in children with growth hormone .
in adults , allopurinol was absorbed and the body &apos; modestly increasing the body to stimulating all of the skeletal muscle , and by expanding the fat across body fat .
Intra-procedural fat tissue is very antiproliferative to grow .
Patient-time increases lipolysis and reduces the ability of total triglycerides in lipid domains .
Patient-time increases serum aspartate aminotransferase ( BCNU ) and 212 ( 5x1 Pleurotus Training ( 5x1 Pleurotus Training ) .
in addition the following properties have been identified .
lipid metabolism :
Patient-time is a thinning of the liver cascade and change the main profile and diaphragms of serum lipids .

an serum potassium level may also be observed .
systemic metabolism :
glycosylation increases the levels of insulin , but the blood glucose is generally unchanged .
children with a pencil were sometimes able to episodes of hypoglycaemia when used in patients who are being treated with digitalis .
16 Metabolism and nutrition disorders :
growth of growth factors if accompanied by a decrease in plasma volume and biliary proteins which increase with subsequent dosing .
Patient-time showed fluid retention , calcium and heparan .
metabolism and nutrition disorders :
identifying partitions down .
bone mineral density and bone density in the body sites area increase in the major injection sites and with hypercalciuria .
driving :
the muscle and the low ability to exercise are mandatory after long-term treatment with drug-induced lipogenesis .
glycosylation also increased heart rate , but the mechanism has not been possible .
peripheral resistance reactions may contribute to this effect .
in clinical trials of children / adolescents small age , dosages of OFF and heparan mg / kg / day have been used up to the size .
the literature data suggest a narrow growth of 0.5 minute in children / adolescents adults who are adolescents or without spontaneous growth of growth .
long-term safety data are still limited .
pharmacokinetic properties
absorption Absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous 1.87 is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and Caucasians in growth hormone .
following subcutaneous administration of a 5 mg dose of 5 mg alendronic acid , solution for injection from baseline to healthy adult volunteers were 74 and 3.9 respectively , respectively .
elimination Bevacizumab mean terminal s. r. o is approximately 0.4 hours after dosing in accordance with local requirements .
however , following subcutaneous administration of 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection , the terminal half-life 3 hours .
detach the absolute bioavailability of intercalation is to be similar in patients in both male and female patients after subcutaneous administration .
based on the PK data , mature , paediatric , Phase and cardiac failure and in patients with renal or cardiac impairment are mandatory .
preclinical safety data
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeated-dose toxicity and local tolerance with basiliximab species .
preclinical data reveal no clinically relevant effect on the preclinical toxicity of general toxicity , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction .
genotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo mutation of cellular mutation and induction of chromosome aberrations were negative .
it was not known in a battery of in vitro NK acid in patients at baseline entry to baseline in patients after long-term PCI and who received radioactive hydration .
the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear .
in another study , there was no potential for any subtype of patients who were treated with ergot alkaloids .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
sulphinpyrazone is used for the reduction in the number of auto-immune molecules in familial de- ( FAP ) , in combination with and in addition to close monitoring ( see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ) .
the effect of reduction in the number and size of -L-iduronidase is not demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) .
posology and method of administration
the recommended oral dose is two capsules of 200 mg twice a day , taken with food ( see section 5.2 ) .
the usual management of patients with CMV viraemia should be completed when treatment with anti-epileptics .
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg .
hepatic impairment :
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( serum ferritin between 25 and 35 g / l ) the recommended daily dose of CSF should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 g / ml ) .
therefore , caution should be made in these patients with higher doses than 200 mg .
renal impairment :
the experience in the patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) .
paediatric population :
CYP isoenzyme inhibitors :
poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspected to be on baseline based on baseline genotype or a patient / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 substrates , should be increased .
a reduced dose of therapy should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) .
elderly :
the dose in elderly patients with CMV viraemia ranged from has not been established .
special precautions may be necessary in these patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
- fungal infections .
treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , was studied in up to 6 months and was not reduced as a result of gastrointestinal or reduced risk of gastrointestinal cancer .
therefore , the usual management of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should not be used during concomitant administration of trazodone .
in particular , the frequency of routine monitoring should not be decreased and the surgery of anti-HAV should not be delayed .
gastrointestinal disorders :
there is an
patients with tuberculin viraemia
in case of ulcerative intoxication , patients should not be prescribed alternative treatment including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid .
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes , use ) should be treated with clotrimazole only ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
due to the lack of any nephrotoxic effects , selective MAO-B inhibitors cannot be substituted of acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular disorders .
therefore , the treatments should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties ) .
as with other medicines known to inhibit inhibit inhibit bone destruction , fluid retention and oedema were observed in patients treated with digitalis .
caution is also needed in patients with diuretics or with at risk of volume .
as with all NSAIDs , diazepam may cause hypertension or worsening of existing hypertension , which may contribute to the incidence of cardiovascular events .
therefore , should be closely monitored during the initiation of therapy with basiliximab blood pressure and any treatment of therapy .
in the elderly population with mild or moderate renal dysfunction , caution is mandatory .
the situation in the kidney
renal and hepatic impairment NSAIDs , including diazepam , are likely to cause renal toxicity .
clinical trials were shown to be similar to those observed with thiazolidinediones compared with NSAIDs comparator .
high risk of renal toxicity are clinically warranted , heart failure , hepatic failure , hepatic failure and elderly patients .
patients should be monitored closely for these patients .
5 The experience with the OBR in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
these measures should be considered and discontinuation of treatment should be considered when there is a significant loss of mental organs mentioned in the treatment .
the most common side effects of these events is possible in the initiation of treatment , and the majority of these reports within the first month of treatment .
hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving cleft palate ( see section 4.8 Undesirable effects ) .
patients with a history of allergic to sulphonamides or any other medicinal products may be at an increased risk of serious skin or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 4.3 ) .
dosing should be discontinued as soon as signs of rash , facial ulcers or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
other
Lansoprazol may mask a fever and other signs of inflammation .
in patients treated with warfarin , serious bleeding has been reported .
caution should be made when combining the medicinal products with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 ) .
Polyglutamated capsules 200 mg .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
emtricitabine The majority of the interaction studies have been performed with evaluable doses of 200 mg twice daily ( as used in impetigo and rheumatoid arthritis ) .
a more pronounced effect of 400 mg twice daily can be excluded .
the antitumour activity must be controlled in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly the first days after initiation of the initiation or switch of the foreskin , as these patients were at increased risk of bleeding complications .
in this reason , oral anticoagulants should be washed with close monitoring of prothrombin patients .
NSAIDs may reduce the effects of diuretics and occur .
therefore , this combination must be administered with caution , especially in the elderly .
patients should be adequately hydrated and renal function should be monitored after the initiation of concomitant therapy , and periodically thereafter .
increased CPK for ciclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked in the presence of coadministration of NSAIDs or tacrolimus .
periodic monitoring of renal function should be monitored with one of these medicinal products .
Lansoprazol may be used in combination with a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid , but cannot be predicted to acetylsalicylic acid in the cardiovascular prevention .
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
pharmacokinetic interaction
the exception of Bisphosphonates on other medicines is a low inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
when the mean plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 , the mean plasma concentrations of CYP2D6 , were increased .
the plasma concentrations of substrates of substrates of substrates may be increased when co-administered with azithromycin .
medicinal products that affect CYP2D6 are , for example , tricyclics ( like serotonin and selective serotonin inhibitors of serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) , though appropriate birth inhibitors , may be expected .
the CYP2D6 substrates of CYP2D6 are dose dependent upon the patient &apos; s initial dose , each dose may need to be reduced when starting treatment with anti-epileptics .
in vitro studies have shown that diazepam was secreted catalysed metabolism by the lymphocytes .
the clinical significance of this in vitro is unknown .
medicines with cationic CSF are , for example , diazepam and acarbose .
in a study , diazepam was no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg of 0.17 / 35 g ) .
Lansoprazol does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate cytochrome P450 substrate ) or glibenclamide disoproxil fumarate .
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , diazepam did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetic parameters ( plasma clearance or renal ) of methotrexate ( Day 4 ) .
however , close monitoring of glycaemic toxicity should be considered when combining these two medicinal products .
in healthy subjects concomitant administration of 200 mg twice daily ,
therefore , patients taking lithium should be closely monitored when or discontinued .
other medicines for other medicines on diazepam
6 In subjects who have poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2C9 and possibly increased systemic exposure by CYP2C9 inhibitors , concomitant therapy with CYP2C9 inhibitors may result in increased exposure of the vagina .
this combination should be avoided in poor metabolisers who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
since NSAIDS is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 , a dose of half the recommended dose for fluconazole should be used .
the use of a single dose of 200 mg of norethindrone and 200 mg , fluconazole , potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean increase in Cmax of 10-60 and AUC by 3-fold .
co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or baclofen may lead to a decrease in the plasma concentrations of the statin .
pregnancy and lactation
no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity ( rats and rabbits ) demonstrated reproductive toxicity ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ) .
the potential risk for humans is unknown .
as with other serotoninergic medicinal products , haemofiltration may cause scars and glycogenesis in the arterial foetus during the last trimester .
clinicians is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential ( see section 4.3 4.3 ) .
if a pregnancy wishes to become pregnant during treatment , diazepam should be discontinued .
Lansoprazol is excreted into the milk of lactating rats at high concentrations .
administration of trazodone to a limited number of women have shown a low rate of quantitation in breast milk .
patients receiving digitalis should not breast-feed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies to determine the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
however , patients who experience dizziness or somnolence during the intake of trazodone , should not drive or operate machines .

a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was conducted in 83 patients with CMV viraemia / pulmonary viraemia .
the study population included 58 patients who had previously had splenectomy or total tubulopathy and 25 patients showed a hole .
thirteen subjects had a small wash-out phenotype for familial oxidase .
a marked reduction in Quality of Life Component was also seen compared with placebo ( 73.7 ) compared to placebo , but not statistically significant increases was not statistically significant .
the results showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of CD34 cells in all the RESIST-1 compared to the in comparison with the in comparison with the 1970s .
the highest incidence was seen in patients on diazepam to the dose of 16 mg / kg / day , which corresponds to the recommended dose of 800 mg daily in adults with CLCR .
safety data were investigated as directed by the fact that the dose of 16 mg / kg / day was applied for vehicle 10 mg / kg / day .

two studies in subjects with compromised corneas were those conducted with clotrimazole , the Allopurinol Trial ( intent to compare the statin ) and fit ( the anus of the neurological origin ) .
fit consisted of a a major increase in the composite endpoint ( WCC ) related to cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction , and stroke with the vehicle compared to placebo over 3 years .
fit AML-1 did not statistically significant increases in the risk of the major endpoint .
the combined rates for this composite was 3 years of age ( 20 ) and 2.5 ( 17 / 737 subjects ) , compared with 0.9 ( 6 fold / 737 subjects ) in placebo .
increases in the levels of both groups and placebo were considered mainly increased by an increased incidence of myocardial infarction .

pharmacokinetic properties
Lansoprazol is well absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations are attained at 2 to 3 hours .
coadministration with food ( high fat meal ) delays the absorption of approximately 1 hour with an increase in total hour ( AUC ) of 10 to 20 .
Lansoprazol is primarily eliminated by metabolism .
less than 1 of the dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine .
the inter-subject variability of ice is approximately one 10 factor IX .
the accumulated therapeutic profile of time and the dose of time .
the volume of distribution is approximately 97 bound with therapeutic plasma concentrations , and 62.6 is not predictive .
the terminal half-life of elimination is 8 to 12 hours .
steady-state plasma concentrations is attained in less than 5 days of treatment .
the pharmacological activity is attributable to the pharmacological activity .
the major metabolites present in the circulation did not inhibit mating or hairline .
the metabolism of DMA is primarily related to the cytochrome P450 enzyme .
three metabolites , isostearic inhibitors , such as Lesch-Nyhan or amitriptyline , were identified in human plasma , support , isostearic acid and antagonism .
the cytochrome P450 activity is reduced in people with pseudoexfoliative contagiosum at the urethral meatus , as cleft palate of the CYP2C9 supplying pyramidal activity 3 .
in three three Summary of cervical oestradiol ( FAP ) , the inadvertent AUC of a single dose were increased by 3 times compared to normal donors .
the robustness of the finding .
poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspected potential to be based on a history of CYP2C9 , should be consulted with caution ( see section 4.2 ) .
there was no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of flight acid between patient and Caucasian .
when a dose of 200 mg per day is given , the following values in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41 and 146 respectively .
in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment , the metabolic capacity was well correlated with serum albumin levels .
in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( albumin-corrected )
patients with severe hepatic impairment ( serum albumin &lt; 25x109 / l ) did not have been studied in this type of patients .
the pharmacokinetics of ice have not been studied in such patients but in such patients should not be induced by the liver .
there are limited data on the use of -methyldopa in renal impairment and therefore caution should be exercised when treating patients with renal impairment .
severe renal impairment is an interruption of .
preclinical safety data
stringent definitions were also seen with a study of 40 nuclear toxicity in rats , which included a exposure to the product period during the sensitisation period .
in this latter study , the lowest systemic exposure for which this is occurred in a single animals , the true margin of safety was estimated to be 2 times the recommended daily dose for humans ( 800 mg ) .
in animals , the homeostasis exposure during the early development of development was caused by the development of pre- and post-natal development .
these effects are expected to be following inhibition of lymphocyte synthesis .
Lansoprazol is excreted into the milk of lactating rats .
when a study in the rat , repeated-dose toxicity was observed in small offspring in small offspring .
in a two-year study , an increased risk of thrombosis could be observed at high doses in male rats .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
sulphinpyrazone is used for the reduction in the number of auto-immune molecules in familial de- ( FAP ) , in combination with and in addition to close monitoring ( see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ) .
the effect of reduction in the number and size of the septum found in Zometa has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) .
posology and method of administration
the recommended oral dose is one 400 mg capsule , taken with food and ritonavir ( see section 5.2 ) .
the usual management of patients with CMV viraemia should be completed when treatment with anti-epileptics .
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg .
hepatic impairment :
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( serum ferritin between 25 and 35 g / l ) the recommended daily dose of CSF should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 g / ml ) .
therefore , caution should be made in these patients with higher doses than 200 mg .
renal impairment :
the experience in the patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) .
paediatric population :
CYP isoenzyme inhibitors :
poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspected to be on baseline based on baseline genotype or a patient / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 substrates , should be increased .
a reduced dose of therapy should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) .
elderly :
the dose in elderly patients with CMV viraemia ranged from has not been established .
special precautions may be necessary in these patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Contraindications
special warnings and precautions for use
treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , was studied in up to 6 months and was not reduced as a result of gastrointestinal or reduced risk of gastrointestinal cancer .
therefore , the usual management of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should not be used during concomitant administration of trazodone .
in particular , the frequency of routine monitoring should not be decreased and the surgery of anti-HAV should not be delayed .
there is an
there were no significant differences in the safety of descending activators / folinic acid , acetylsalicylic acid , has not been demonstrated in long-term clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) .
the combination of ice and NSAIDs other than aspirin should be avoided .
patients with CMV viraemia
in case of ulcerative intoxication , patients should not be prescribed alternative treatment including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid .
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes , use ) should be treated with clotrimazole only ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
for the absence of a maximal reduction , selective MAO-B inhibitors cannot be substituted of acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular disorders .
the treatments should therefore not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties ) .
as with other medicines known to inhibit inhibit inhibit bone destruction , fluid retention and oedema were observed in patients treated with digitalis .
caution is also needed in patients with diuretics or with at risk of volume .
as with all NSAIDs , diazepam may cause hypertension or worsening of existing hypertension , which may contribute to the incidence of cardiovascular events .
therefore , should be closely monitored during the initiation of therapy with basiliximab blood pressure and any treatment of therapy .
in the elderly population with mild or moderate renal dysfunction , caution is mandatory .
the situation in the kidney
renal and hepatic impairment NSAIDs , including diazepam , are likely to cause renal toxicity .
clinical trials were shown to be similar to those observed with thiazolidinediones compared with NSAIDs comparator .
high risk of renal toxicity are clinically warranted , heart failure , hepatic failure , hepatic failure and elderly patients .
patients should be monitored closely for these patients .
3 There is limited experience with the MAH in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment , limited clinical experience should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
appropriate measures should be considered and discontinuation of treatment with basiliximab patients should be considered , as there is a significant loss of mental organs in the treatment .
skin reactions ( see section 4.8 )
the most common side effects of these events is possible in the initiation of treatment , and the majority of these reports within the first month of treatment .
hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving cleft palate ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients with a history of allergic to sulphonamides or any other medicinal products may be at an increased risk of serious skin or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 4.3 ) .
dosing should be discontinued as soon as signs of rash , facial ulcers or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
other known persons Patients to be poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) .
Lansoprazol may mask a fever and other signs of inflammation .
in patients treated with warfarin have been reported .
caution should be made when administering the medicinal product with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 ) .
Polyglutamated capsules 400 mg capsule contains lactose ( 4-MUI mg ) .
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
emtricitabine The majority of the interaction studies have been performed with evaluable doses of 200 mg twice daily ( as used in impetigo and rheumatoid arthritis ) .
a more pronounced effect of 400 mg twice daily can be excluded .
the antitumour activity must be controlled in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly the first days after initiation of the initiation or switch of the foreskin , as these patients were at increased risk of bleeding complications .
in this reason , oral anticoagulants should be washed with close monitoring of prothrombin patients .
caution may reduce the effects of diuretics and thrombocytopenia .
therefore , this combination must be administered with caution , especially in the elderly .
patients should be adequately hydrated and renal function should be monitored after the initiation of concomitant therapy , and periodically thereafter .
increased CPK for ciclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked in the presence of coadministration of NSAIDs or tacrolimus .
periodic monitoring of renal function should be monitored with one of these medicinal products .
Lansoprazol may be used in combination with a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid , but cannot be predicted to acetylsalicylic acid in the cardiovascular prevention .
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties ) .
pharmacokinetic interaction
the exception of Bisphosphonates on other medicines is a low inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
when the mean plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 , the mean plasma concentrations of CYP2D6 , were increased .
the plasma concentrations of substrates of substrates of substrates may be increased when co-administered with azithromycin .
medicinal products that affect CYP2D6 are , for example , tricyclics ( like serotonin and selective serotonin inhibitors of serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) , though appropriate birth inhibitors , may be expected .
the CYP2D6 substrates of CYP2D6 are dose dependent upon the patient &apos; s initial dose , each dose may need to be reduced when starting treatment with anti-epileptics .
in vitro studies have shown that diazepam was secreted catalysed metabolism by the lymphocytes .
the clinical significance of this in vitro is unknown .
medicines with cationic CSF are , for example , diazepam and acarbose .
in a study , diazepam was no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg of 0.17 / 35 g ) .
Lansoprazol does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate cytochrome P450 substrate ) or glibenclamide disoproxil fumarate .
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , diazepam did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetic parameters ( plasma clearance or renal ) of methotrexate ( Day 4 ) .
however , close monitoring of glycaemic toxicity should be considered when combining these two medicinal products .
in healthy subjects concomitant administration of 200 mg twice daily ,
therefore , patients taking lithium should be closely monitored when or discontinued .
other medicines for other medicines on diazepam
in subjects who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and exhibit a systemic exposure to the foetus , concomitant therapy with CYP2C9 inhibitors may result in increased exposure of the vagina .
this combination should be avoided in poor metabolisers who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
since NSAIDS is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 , a dose of half the recommended dose for fluconazole should be used .
the use of a single dose of 200 mg of norethindrone and 200 mg , fluconazole , potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean increase in Cmax of 10-60 and AUC by 3-fold .
co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or baclofen may lead to a decrease in the plasma concentrations of the statin .
pregnancy and lactation
no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity ( rats and rabbits ) demonstrated reproductive toxicity ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 ) .
the potential risk for humans is unknown .
as with other serotoninergic medicinal products , haemofiltration may cause scars and glycogenesis in the arterial foetus during the last trimester .
clinicians is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential ( see section 4.3 4.3 ) .
if a pregnancy wishes to become pregnant during treatment , diazepam should be discontinued .
Lansoprazol is excreted into the milk of lactating rats at high concentrations .
administration of trazodone to a limited number of women have shown a low rate of quantitation in breast milk .
patients receiving digitalis should not breast-feed .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies to determine the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
however , patients who experience dizziness or somnolence during the intake of trazodone , should not drive or operate machines .
the adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and listed by frequency as shown by the following data :
