pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
selective inhibitor of recharge monoamine , ATC ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
clomipramine has a wide spectre of action by blocking the neuronal recaptage combined serotonin ( 5HT ) and noradrenaline . 
therefore , it has properties of an inhibitor of recaptage conjointes serotonin and an antidepressant tricyclique . 
the active molecules in vivo are clomipramine and its main metabolite , the déméthylclomipramine . 
clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine contribute to the activity of Clomicalm : clomipramine is a potent and selective inhibitor of recaptage serotonin 5HT , whereas the déméthylclomipramine is a potent and selective inhibitor of recaptage noradrenaline . 
the mode of action primary of clomipramine réside in potentiation of effects of norepinephrine and serotonin 5HT in the brain by the inhibition of neuronal recaptage . 
in addition , clomipramine has effects anticholinergiques by its action on muscarinic receptors cholinergiques antagonist . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
gastrointestinal absorption of clomipramine given orally is good ( &gt; 80 ) in dogs , but the bioavailability of clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine is 22 to 26 due to a effect first . 
peak plasma clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine are rapidly ( 1.5 1.5-2.5 hour ) . 
peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) following a single oral dose of 2 mg / kg clomipramine hydrochloride are 240 nmol / l for clomipramine and 48 nmol / l for the déméthylclomipramine . 
repeated dosing of Clomicalm of entrainent moderate increased plasma concentrations , the relationship of accumulation after oral administration twice daily is 1.2 for clomipramine and 1.6 for the déméthylclomipramine , steady state is reached in 3 days . 
at steady state , the proportion plasma concentrations clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine is approximately 3 to 1 . 
when Clomicalm is administered with food , the plasma AUC are slightly higher 25 for clomipramine and 
4 8 for the déméthylclomipramine , compared to data of administration in dogs fasting . 
clomipramine binds highly bound to plasma proteins ( &gt; 97 ) in dogs . 
in dogs , the volume of distribution is 3.8 l / kg . 
the principal route of the biotransformation of clomipramine is the déméthylation in déméthylclomipramine . 
other metabolites polaires come also . 
the half-life of elimination of clomipramine after intravenous administration is 6,4 hours for clomipramine , and 3.6 hours for the déméthylclomipramine . 
the main route of excretion is biliary dog ( &gt; 80 ) , the remainder excreted via the kidney .

how Convenia fonctionne-t-il ? 
the active substance of Convenia is the céfovécine which belongs to a group of antibiotics called céphalosporines of third offspring . 
all of these céphalosporines , including the céfovécine , tuent the by preventing the bacteria making their cell wall , which exhibit death bacteria and healing infection . 
like other antibiotics , the céfovécine is not effective against all types of bacteria . 
data from studies in laboratory on different bacteria have shown that the céfovécine was efficacious against the bacteria provided in the information product ( SPC and leaflet ) .

pharmacodynamic properties 
the céfovécine is a céphalosporine of third offspring that has a wide spectre of activity against the bacteria Gram-positif and Gram-négatif . 
it is différencie there other céphalosporines by its high protein binding and its long duration of action . 
as with all céphalosporines , the action of the céfovécine result of the inhibition of wall synthesis bacterial ; the céfovecine has a bactéricide activity . 
the céfovécine has a activity in vitro against Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella multocida which are associated with infections of the skin in dogs and chats . 
it has also been prouvé that the bacteria anaérobies as Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. alone in abscesses félins are sensitive to the céfovécine . 
in addition , the céfovécine has a activity in vitro against Escherichia coli which is associated with the urinary tract infections in dogs and chats .

the more small concentration , which inhibits completely growth up of at least 50 of isolates 2 The more small concentration , which inhibits completely growth up of at least 90 of isolates 3 Some of these pathogènes ( e. g . 
S. aureus ) have shown in vitro resistance neutralization to the céfovécine 4 The clinical significance of these data in vitro has not been demonstrated . 
the resistance to céphalosporines inactivation result of an enzyme ( production de-lactamase ) , a reduction in the permeability by mutations of porines or change in the transporter , or a séléction protein low affinités for penicillin . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be sent if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
a cross-resistance with other céphalosporines and other béta-lactamines may be observed . 
in appliquant concentration microbiological critique suggested of S 2 g / ml , no resistance to the céfovécine were detected for isolates terrains of Pasteurella multocida and Fusobacterium spp . 
in appliquant concentration microbiological critique suggested of I 4 g / ml , resistance to the céfovécine in isolates of S. intermedius and Streptococci béta-hémolitique is below 0.02 . 
the percentage resistant isolates of E. coli , Prevotella oralis , Bacteroides spp. and Proteus spp. were by 2.3 , 2.7 , 3.1 and 1.4 . 
the percentage of Staphylococci isolates spp. coagulase negative ( e. g. 
S. xylosus , S. schleiferi , S. epidermidis ) resistant to céfovécine is 9.5 .

what DEXDOMITOR ? 
DEXDOMITOR contains the active substance dexmédétomidine , which belongs to a group of medicines dotés a action psycholeptique ( sédative ) . 
it is a solution for injection . 
what is DEXDOMITOR used ? 
it is used in the setting of procedures , i. e. not invasive do not comportent of leakage through the skin or through an body bleeding , before induction of a general anaesthesia . 
the dose is selected according to the unknown treated , indication , the type of intravenous injection or musculaire- and administration of other medicinal products . 
in dogs , this dose depends on the body surface area ( calculated on the basis of body weight ) ; in the chat , it depends on body weight . 
in dogs , DEXDOMITOR is given by injection into a vein ( intravenously ) or intramuscular ( into a muscle ) . 
in the chat , the product is administered by intramuscular injection . 
the duration and the depth of the sedation and analgésie depend on the dose used . 
the active substance of DEXDOMITOR , the dexmédétomidine , is a agoniste alpha-2-adrénergiques receptor . 
since norepinephrine in the maintaining alertness and éveil , a decrease in its release reduces the level of consciousness , including the feeling pain . 
in dogs , has studied both injections intraveineuses and intramusculaires of DEXDOMITOR . 
DEXDOMITOR has also been compared to the médétomidine , in the indication of préanesthésie in chats devant undergo a general anaesthesia and ketamine , and in the indication of sedation deep of dog , in combination with the butorphanol . 
finally , DEXDOMITOR has been studied as préanesthésie in dogs , before induction of the general anaesthesia . 
what benefit by DEXDOMITOR shown during the studies ? 
studies have shown that DEXDOMITOR had a efficacy equivalent to that of the médétomidine for induction of the sedation and for the analgésie in dogs and chat . 
in the médétomidine , a analgésie good or excellent was achieved in approximately 40 to 50 of animals , support its use in the setting not invasive involving pain mild to moderate . 
DEXDOMITOR was at least as effective as the médétomidine in the induction of the general anaesthesia in the chat , in combination with ketamine . 
DEXDOMITOR has also been evidence of efficacy for the deep sedation of dog in combination with the butorphanol , as well as for préanesthésie before induction of a general anaesthetic , which reduces the amount of anaesthetic including dogs have necessary . 
what is the risk associated with the use of DEXDOMITOR ? 
DEXDOMITOR induced decreased heart rate and body temperature . 
in addition , observera an increase in blood pressure , which retournera then to normal levels or lower than normal . 
in some dogs and chats , there can be a reduction in frequency breathing and mucous membranes may become pâles or bleuâtres . 
vomiting may occur five to 10 minutes after the injection or at the time of waking up . 
a tremblement and opacités cornéennes ( tasks general on cornea Part clear the oeil devant the pupille ) may occur during the sedation . 
other side effects may occur when DEXDOMITOR is used in combination with other medicinal products . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with the use of DEXDOMITOR , see the Package Leaflet . 
page 2 / 3 EMEA 2007 DEXDOMITOR should not be used in the chiots aged below six months or chatons aged less than five months . 
before you to take precautions to by the person which by the medicine or contacts with animals ? 
if DEXDOMITOR is auto-injecté accidentally or taken orally , consult a doctor immediately and montrez the package leaflet or label the doctor . 
however , do not drive , due to the risk of sedation and changes in blood pressure . 
avoid contact with skin , eyes or mucous membranes ( surfaces corporelles humides ) . 
contact , rinse water . 
the use of gloves imperméables is recommended . 
pregnant women should particularly paid to avoid of self-administration . 
people with hypersensitivity to the dexmédétomidine or to any of the other ingredients should be careful when the use of this medicine .

it is also advised oxygen readily available in case of quantitation or suspected of hypoxaemia . 
dogs and chats from and déficients should only receive pre-treatment of dexmédétomidine before induction and the maintenance of general anaesthetic , taking into consideration the benefit-risk balance . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen dog significantly reduces the dosage of the agent required to induction of anaesthesia . 
the vétérinaire should be particularly be considered when administering the agent induction intravenously , until such the effect escompté . 
the dexmédétomidine delivers also decreasing the dose of the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia .

3 Avis doctors : 
symptoms after absorption include : sedation dose-dependent respiratory depression , bradycardia , hypotension , dry mouth and hyperglycaemia . 
there was also reported cases of ventricular arrhythmias . 
symptoms breathing and hémodynamiques should be treated concomitantly symptomatic . 
the specific antagonist of the receptors , 2-adrénergiques atipamézole , authorised for use in animals , has been used in humans as way animal reproduction to make opposer to mediated by the dexmédétomidine . 
people with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to excipients of the product should be administered with caution . 
side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
because of its activity 2-adrénergique , the dexmédétomidine causes a reduction of heart rate and body temperature . 
blood pressure will start by increase , then is normalise or reached values lower than normal . 
in some dogs and chats , a reduction in frequency respiratory may occur . 
because of the vasoconstriction peripheral and désaturation in a venous animal with other a oxygenation blood normal , a pale and / or cyanosis mucous membranes may be observed . 
there have been told by a few rare cases of pulmonary oedema . 
vomiting may occur 5 to 10 minutes after the injection . 
some dogs and some chats may also sick at waking up . 
shaking muscle may occur during the sedation . 
of opacités of cornea may occur during the sedation ( see also section 4.5 ) . 
if sequential of dexmédétomidine and ketamine , over the range of 10 minutes , the chats can sometimes have blockade auriculo-ventriculaire or extra heart beats . 
the effects respiratory expected are bradypnée , a rate , the respiratory intermittent hypoventilation and apnoea . 
in clinical trials , the incidence cases of hypoxaemia was common , particularly in the first 15 minutes after anaesthesia to the dexmédétomidine-kétamine . 
vomiting , hypothermia and cases of nervousness have been reported after this type of administration . 
cases of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia have been reported . 
these medicinal products may include a sinus bradycardia , auriculo-ventriculaires deep down the first and second degree , discontinuation sinusal as well as in fibrinolysis fibrillation and Supra-ventricular arrhythmia , , and a extra heart beats arrhythmias . 
cases of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia have been reported . 
these medicinal products may include a sinus bradycardia , auriculo-ventriculaires deep down the first and second degree , as well as discontinuation sinusal . 
Supra-ventricular arrhythmia , , a of fibrinolysis extra heart beats arrhythmias , a sinus pause and down auriculo-ventriculaires third degree were seen in rare cases . 
use in case of gravidité , or ponte lactation 
the safety of the dexmédétomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation species in the Target . 
therefore , its use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended . 
drug-drug and other 
concomitant use of other central nervous system dépresseurs should lead to potentiation of effects of dexmédétomidine , the dose should therefore be adjusted accordingly . 
the use of anticholinergiques with the dexmédétomidine should be given with caution . 
administration of atipamézole after the dexmédétomidine reverse raccourcit rapidly its effects and therefore the time of recovery . 
in general , the dogs réveillent and tiennent on their pattes after 15 minutes . 
chats : 
following coadministration 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg body vif intramuscularly and 5 mg ketamine / kg poidsvif , maximum concentration of dexmédétomidine was grow two , but it is did observed no effect on T max . 
the mean elimination half-life of the dexmédétomidine is passée to 1.6 h and the total exposure ( AUC ) increased by 50 . 
coadministration of a dose of 10 mg ketamine / kg and 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg can cause fits tachycardia . 
for more information on the side effects , see section 4.6 Undesirable effects . 
for more information on the safety of animals in the event of overdose , see the section 4.10 Surdosage . 
posology and route of administration 
this product is designed to : 
- Chiens : intramuscular or intravenous use 
- Chats : intramuscular use 
this product is not censé be injected in several times . 
it is may mix the dexdormitor , the butorphanol and / or ketamine in the same syringe their compatibility Form has been demonstrated . 
the recommended doses are as follows : 
dogs : 
for doses dogs are their body surface area . 
the dose is 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area intravenously and 500 micrograms / m2 intramuscularly when the dexmédétomidine is used as single agent of sedation and analgésie . 
the dose should be adjusted at type of surgery , the duration of the procedure and tempérament of the patient . 
5 The concomitant use of dexmédétomidine and butorphanol ensures a with sedation and analgésie effects occur within 15 minutes . 
the effects sedative and analgesics are maximaux 30 minutes after administration. and are maintained respectively up to 120 minutes and 90 minutes after administration . 
a waking up was abortion within 3 hours . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen significantly reduces the dosage of the agent induction necessary , as well as that of the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia . 
in a clinical study , the dose of propofol and thiopental requested were respectively reduced 30 and 60 . 
all anaesthetic agents used for the induction or keeping anaesthesia should be administered until such the effect escompté . 
another clinical study showed that the dexmédétomidine contribuait to a analgésie postoperative 0.5 to 4 hours . 
however , this duration depends on a number of variableset a dose of analgesic additional may therefore be given , according to the advice . 
the following Tables répertorient dosing gave depending on the weight vif . 
to ensure proper strength précis when administering small volumes , it is recommended to use a measuring syringe .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : psycholeptique , ATC ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the dexmédétomidine is the active substance of Dexdomitor which catalyses cognitive and analgesic in dogs and chats . 
the duration and the depth of the sedation and analgésie are dose-dépendantes . 
the maximal effect occurring corresponds to a animals détendu , lying down , and do not respond to a stimulus extérieurs . 
the dexmédétomidine is a potent and selective agoniste receptor 2-adrénergiques , which inhibits the release noradrenaline from neurones noradrénergiques . 
the neurotransmission sympathique is inhibited and the level of consciousness decreases . 
administration of dexmédétomidine may lead to a reduction of heart rate and blockade temporary auriculo-ventriculaire . 
after initial increased , blood pressure decreases reaching normal or values slightly lower . 
respiratory rate can sometimes reduce . 
the dexmédétomidine induced also a number of other effects associated with receptors 2-adrénergiques include : pilo-érection , depression toxicity motor and sécrétoires the gastrointestinal tract , and diuresis hyperglycaemia . 
sometimes was a slight decrease in room . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the dexmédétomidine is a compound lipophile , it is well absorbed following an intramuscular administration . 
the dexmédétomidine is rapidly distributed in the body and franchit easily the haematoencephalic barrier . 
in studies performed in rats , the maximum concentration in the central nervous system is several times the corresponding plasma concentration . 
in the blood , the dexmédétomidine is extensively bound to plasma proteins ( &gt; 90 ) . 
dogs : 
after intramuscular administration of a dose of 50 micrograms / kg , a maximum plasma concentration of approximately 12 ng / ml is achieved after 0.6 hour . 
the bioavailability of the dexmédétomidine reached 60 and the apparent volume of distribution ( Vss ) is 0.9 l / kg . 
the elimination half-life ( t ) is between 40 and 50 minutes . the major biotransformation reactions dog are hydroxylation , the glucuronoconjugaison and N-méthylation in the liver . 
all metabolites known are their nitrogen- free pharmacological activity . 
the metabolites are excreted principally in urine , and to a lesser extent in the faeces . 
the dexmédétomidine has a high clearance and its elimination depends on the hepatic blood rate . 
it should therefore be expected to a prolongation of the elimination half-life with experience or when the dexmédétomidine is given at the same time as other medicines influant on the hepatic circulation . 
chats : 
maximum plasma concentration is reached approximately 0.24 h after intramuscular administration . 
after administration of 40 micrograms / kg , the Cmax is 17 ng / ml . 
the apparent volume of distribution ( Vss ) is 2.2 l / kg and the elimination half-life ( t ) of one hour . 
in the chat reactions , biotransformation occurs by hydroxylation in the liver . 
the metabolites are excreted principally in urine ( 51 of dose ) , and to a lesser extent in the faeces . 
as in dogs , the dexmédétomidine has a high clearance and its elimination depends on the hepatic blood rate . 
it should therefore be expected to a prolongation of the elimination half-life with experience or when the dexmédétomidine is given at the same time as other medicines that influent on the hepatic circulation .

this product is not intended for several injections . 
it is may mix the dexdormitor , the butorphanol and / or ketamine in the same syringe their compatibility Form has been demonstrated . 
the recommended doses are as follows : 
dogs : 
for doses dogs are their body surface area . 
the dose is 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area intravenously and 500 micrograms / m2 intramuscularly when the dexmédétomidine is used as single agent of sedation and analgésie . 
when this product is given with butorphanol ( 0.1 mg / kg ) in the sedation and analgésie DVTs ) , the dose intramuscular is 300 micrograms / m2 of body surface area . 
the dose of the dexmédétomidine in premedication regimen is 125- 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area administered 20 minutes before induction of procedures in require anaesthetic . 
the dose should be adjusted at type of surgery , the duration of the procedure and tempérament of the patient . 
the use of dexmédétomidine together and butorphanol ensures a with sedation and analgésie effects occur within 15 minutes . 
the effects sedative and analgesics are maximaux 30 minutes after administration and are maintained respectively up to 120 minutes and 90 minutes after administration . 
a waking up was abortion within 3 hours . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen significantly reduces the dosage of the agent induction necessary , as well as that of the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia . 
in a clinical study , the dose of propofol and thiopental requested were respectively reduced 30 and 60 . 
all anaesthetic agents used for the induction or keeping anaesthesia should be administered until such the effect escompté . 
another clinical study showed that the dexmédétomidine contribuait to a analgésie postoperative 0.5 to 4 hours .

subcutaneous administration of DRAXXIN in the bovins commonly causes a transient pain and swelling at the injection site may persist up to 30 days . 
these reactions have not been observed in the porcins following an intramuscular administration . 
pathomorphologiques reactions at the injection site persistent approximately 30 days after the injection in both species . 
use in case of gravidité , or ponte lactation 
laboratory studies in rats and rabbits did not reveal any teratogenic effect , foetotoxique or maternotoxique . 
the safety of the tulathromycine during pregnancy and lactation has not been demonstrated in the bovins and porcins . 
the use should only be after benefit / risk evaluation established by the vétérinaire 
drug-drug and other 
a cross-resistance occurs with other macrolides . 
do not be administered concurrently with other antibacterial with mode of action similar , such as macrolides or lincosamides . 
posology and route of administration 
a single injection subcutaneously of 2,5mg / kg tulathromycine ( equivalent to 1 ml / 40kg ) . 
for the treatment of bovins weighing more than 300 kg , divide the dose of way to do not inject more than 7.5 ml at the same site of administration . 
a single injection intramuscularly of 2,5mg / kg tulathromycine ( equivalent to 1 ml / 40kg ) in the neck . 
for the treatment of porcins weighing more than 80 kg , divide the dose of way to do not inject more than 2 ml at the same site of administration . 
it is recommended in early phase animals disease and evaluate response within 48 hours after the injection . 
if clinical signs of persistent or subsequently respiratory disease , or in cases of relapse treatment should be changed using another antibiotic and continued until clinical signs disappear . 
to ensure a dosing , the weight of animals should be determined also precisely as possible to avoid overdose . 
for the vials multi-doses , it is recommended to use a syringe an automatic to minimise the number of effractions the rubber stopper . 
overdose ( symptoms driving emergency , antidotes ) , if necessary 
a slight dégénérescence infarction was observed in the bovins who received 5 to 6 times the recommended dose . 
in the porcelets approximately 10 kg who received 3 or 5 times the therapeutic dose , signs transient attributed to discomfort at the injection site were observed , including a excessive vocalisation and agitation . 
in the case of an injection conducted in the hind legs a boiterie was observed . 
time waiting 
bovins ( goat and abats ) : 
days . 
porcins ( goat and abats ) :

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
macrolides , ATC ATCvet : 
QJ01FA94 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the tulathromycine is an antibiotic semi-synthetic of the family of macrolides from a fermentation process . 
it is différencie of many other macrolides by its long activity which is part due to its 3 groups that is , therefore it part of the sous-classe of triamilides . 
the macrolides are antibiotics who have a bacteriostatic activity , they inhibit biosynthèse proteins aid their binding selective to RNA bacterial ribosome . 
they act in stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-ARNt and ribosome during the process of translocation . 
4 The tulathromycine has a activity in vitro on Mannheima haemolytica , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Haemophilus parasuis bacteria pathogènes the most commonly seen in the conditions respiratory bovines and porcines respectively . 
increased values of CMI was trouvée for some isolates of Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae . 
the tulathromycine was also a activity in vitro against Moraxella bovis pathogenic bactérien , which is the most commonly combined with the kératoconjonctivite infectious bovine ( KCIB ) . 
resistance MLSB may be constitutive or inductible . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be transférable if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
in the bovins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following administration of a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.5 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after administration ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
one large accumulation of the tulathromycine within neutrophils and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of the in vivo tulatromycine site lung infection is not known . 
peak concentrations are followed by a slow exposure with a half-life ( T ) apparent elimination of 90 hours in plasma . 
plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration is 11 l / kg . 
the bioavailability of the tulathromycine after subcutaneous administration in the bovins is approximately 90 . 
in the porcins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following a single administration intramuscular a dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid also absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.6 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after administration ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
one large accumulation of the tulathromycine within neutrophils and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of the in vivo tulatromycine site lung infection is not known . peak concentrations are followed by a slow exposure with a half-life ( T ) apparent elimination 91 hours in plasma . 
plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration is 13.2 l / kg . 
the bioavailability of the tulathromycine following an intramuscular administration in the porcins is approximately 88 .

further INFORMATION 
the tulathromycine is an antibiotic semi-synthetic of the family of macrolides from a fermentation process . 
it is différencie of many other macrolides by its long activity which is part due to its 3 groups that is , therefore it part of the sous-classe of triamilides . 
the macrolides are antibiotics who have a bacteriostatic activity , they inhibit biosynthèse proteins aid their binding selective to RNA bacterial ribosome . 
they act in stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-ARNt and ribosome during the process of translocation . 
the tulathromycine has a activity in vitro on Mannheima haemolytica , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Haemophilus parasuis bacteria pathogènes the most commonly seen in the conditions respiratory bovines and porcines respectively . 
increased values of CMI was trouvée for some isolates of Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae . 
the tulathromycine was also a activity in vitro against Moraxella bovis pathogenic bactérien , which is the most commonly combined with the kératoconjonctivite infectious bovine ( KCIB ) . 
resistance MLSB may be constitutive or inductible . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be transférable if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
in the bovins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following administration of a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.5 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after administration ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
one large accumulation of the tulathromycine within neutrophils and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of the in vivo tulatromycine site lung infection is not known . 
peak concentrations are followed by a slow exposure with a half-life ( T ) apparent elimination of 90 hours in plasma . 
plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration is 11 l / kg . 
37 The bioavailability of the tulathromycine after subcutaneous administration in the bovins is approximately 90 . 
in the porcins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following a single administration intramuscular a dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid also absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.6 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after administration ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
one large accumulation of the tulathromycine within neutrophils and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated .

pharmacodynamic properties 
the medicine vétérinaire is a fixed combination three principes active ( corticosteroid , antifungal and antibiotic ) . 
4 / 20 THE acéponate of hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid a member of diésters which has activity intrinsic glucocorticoid both which means a reduction of the inflammation and pruritus leading to a improved clinical signs observed in the outer otite . 
the nitrate of miconazole is a synthetic derivative of the imidazole with antifungal activity pronounced . 
the miconazole selectively inhibits the synthesis of the ergostérol which is an essential component of the patients membrane and yeast , including Malassezia pachydermatis . 
the mechanisms of resistance to azolés consist of an indication of accumulation of the antifungal or a change in the enzyme target . 
no upper sensitivity standardisée in-vitro has not been defined for the miconazole ; however , with the precise methodology used by Diagnostics Pasteur , no strain refractory has been trouvée . 
the sulphate of gentamicine is an antibiotic bactéricide of the family of aminoglycosides which acts by inhibition of protein synthesis .

the active substance present in Econor is the valnémuline to 0.5 , 1 , 10 and 50 . 
all concentrations may be marketed in your country . 
what is Econor used ? 
Econor is an antibiotic . 
Econor improves health and weight treated porcs , but not fully élimine the bacteria to lung infection . 
Econor is mixed to food of porc . 
the dose and duration of treatment depend on the condition for which the product is used . 
for details , read the Package Leaflet . 
how Econor fonctionne-t-il ? 
the active substance of Econor , the valnémuline , is an antibiotic group of &apos;class . 
its works by blocking the production of protein in the bacteria &apos;s ribosomes of the bacteria and inhibition of the growth of bacteria . 
the valnémuline is active against a wide spectre of bacteria , especially those mediate reached Disorders and respiratory mentioned above . 
the efficacy of the antimicrobienne valnémuline against the bacteria mediate conditions included in the porcs was studied in laboratoires microbiologiques . 
the efficacy of Econor within instructions included was studied in provocation testing ( porcs artificiellement infected with the bacteria ) or in studies on the terrain ( infections natural in conditions of the exploitation ) . 
studies on the terrain were performed in a large number of exploitations of a countries européens on a variety of races and races croisées of porcs . 
Econor was used to treat animals already with by the disease or to prevent the éclosion of the disease in the porcs contact with from or in animals exploitations with a history of réapparitions repeated of the disease . 
in clinical trials , the porcs were only alimentés with the aliment residue containing the valnémuline in different concentrations ( by the disease ) for 4 weeks maximum ( by the disease ) . 
the efficacy of Econor was compared with that of oral treatment with other antibiotics approuvés in the EU for the indication or animals receiving any treatment . 
what were the benefit Econor during the studies ? 
Econor at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg / kg body weight valnémuline vif / day ( 25 mg / kg aliment ) was prevent effectively the development of the disease . 
in contrast , infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae has not been eliminated . 
Possible side effects associated with Econor ? 
side effects severe observed after administration of Econor are mainly associated with races and races croisées of landrace danois and / or suédois . 
caution should be exercised when the use of Econor in the porcs originaires of Scandinavie . 
the porcs with are a pyrexia ( hyperpyrexia ) , loss of appetite ; in severe cases , the porcs may have the incoordination and are couchés . 
a number of these animals may also show a oedema ( swelling due to a liquid ) or erythema ( redness ) postérieurs and swelling palpébral ( eyelid ) . 
when the occurrence of side effects , the aliment containing Econor should be immediately removed ; the porcs sévèrement with should be treated in a environment clean , dry and it should be initiated appropriate treatment . 
before you to take special care with the person administering the medicine or entrant contact with animals ? 
it should avoid contact with skin , mouth and the nose when it is procède at mixture of Econor and that the final aliment manipule . 
Econor was especially provided at the site for porcs and should not be used in humans . 
however , in case of accidental ingestion of Econor , speak to a doctor immediately and montrez-lui the Package Leaflet . 
caution should be used in people with an allergy to the valnémuline . 
what is the time of abattage waiting prior animals and the use of goat for the human consumption ?

caution for use 
special precautions for use in animals The side effects were observed after administration of Econor . 
their occurrence would be red restreinte countries scandinaves and appears to be primarily associated with races of porcs croisées which include landrace danois and / or suédois . 
caution should be exercised when the use of Econor in the porcs originaires of Scandinavie especially races Landrace Danois and Suédois as well as early croisements . 
special precautions for to take by the person which by the medicine to vétérinaire animals It should avoid contact with skin or mucous membranes when it is procède at mixture of the compound or manipule the aliment containing the product . 
in case of accidental ingestion , speak to a doctor immediately and montrez-lui on the label of the product . 
caution should be used in people with hypersensitivity to the valnémuline when they administrent this product . 
side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
administration of Econor to porcs induced the onset of side effects in the European Union . 
the majority of cases reported in 1999-2000 provenaient of Denmark and Sweden ( 1 of Finlande and 1 of Ireland ) . 
in these countries , the incidence varied between 0.03 to 1.76 . 
in the these élevages , the morbidity was approximately 30 and rate mortality of 1 . 
the porcs with had a hyperthermia , anorexia , and in severe cases the porcs had of the incoordination , ataxia and restaient couchés . 
a number of these animals had also swelling or erythema ( postérieurs ) and a oedema palpébral . 
in controlled clinical trials , these side effects have been studied in animals prédisposés . 
mortality was lower than 1 but may be increased following secondary infections . 
when the occurrence of side effects , discontinuation follow-up of treatment is recommended . 
the porcs sévèrement with should be treated in a environment dry and clean it should be initiated and appropriate symptomatic , including the treatment of concomitant conditions . 
monitoring épidémiologique demonstrated a possible relationship between the prédisposition to side effects and races Landrace Danois and Landrace Suédois as well as early croisements , and this especially in the porcs younger . 
the valnémuline is well acceptée in the diet but of teneurs than 200 mg / kg aliment may lead to , during the first few days of administration , a transient reduction of food with inappétence . 
use in case of gravidité , or ponte lactation 
the safety of the medicinal product in the at truie or who are breastfeeding did however not been established . 
drug-drug and other 
the valnémuline presents interactions with antibiotics ionophores , such as the monensin , the salinomycine and narasin . 
animals should therefore not receive products containing of monensin , salinomycine or narasin during treatment with the valnémuline , or during the 5 days ( less than ) preceding or that share this treatment . 
such a combination risk of cause growth retardation important , ataxia , a paralysis , or death of animals .

the activity of the valnémuline is contrast low against the Enterobacteriaceae as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
in the porc absorption after administration of a single dose of substance radiolabelled is greater than 90 . 
a linear relationship has been established between concentration and the administered dose . 
a slight accumulation was noted after administration of multiple doses but steady state has been reached in 5 days . 
due to extensive first important , plasma concentrations varient according to the method of administration , but the valnémuline is concentre very extensively into tissues , including in lungs and the liver , compared to plasma .

what Prequenza Equilis Te is used for ? 
Equilis Prequenza Te is used to be vaccinated the chevaux from the age of six months against flu équine and tetanus . 
this vaccine reduces clinical signs flu équine and excretion ( elimination ) of virus after infection . 
flu équine is a disease highly contagieuse very common in the chevaux but rarely fatal . 
the vaccine stimulates also protection against tetanus to prevent mortality . 
tetanus is a acute infection , often fatal , due to the neurotoxine produced by the bacteria Clostridium tetani . 
this disease , which is develops often from sores contaminées , characterised by a ( rigidity stiffness ) general and muscle spasms convulsifs . 
the cheval account among the species the more sensitive to tétanos . 
the vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection ( injection into a muscle ) . 
the chevaux receive a first vaccination ( primary ) , consisting of two injections administered at an interval of four weeks . 
for maintain protection , chevaux should receive of rappels . 
for protection against flu équine , the primary immunisation course should be followed five months later a first booster dose , followed by the following annual rappels . 
for protection against tetanus , the first booster dose should be performed at later 17 months after primary vaccination . 
then , an interval maximum of two years is recommended . 
the vaccine also contains a toxoïde tétanique talc . 
when the product is administered to a cheval , it helps the immune system of animals to react more quickly when it is exposed naturally to flu virus équine and the bacteria Clostridium tetani . 
this helps to protect animals against flu équine and tetanus . 
this vaccine also contains an adjuvant &apos; to stimulate a better response . 
how has Equilis Prequenza Te been studied ? 
the safety of Equilis Prequenza Te was studied during several studies in conditions laboratory and on the terrain in a many chevaux , aged between two months and older . 
it was conclu that the product was well tolerated by the chevaux irrespective of their age . 
Equilis Prequenza Te has also been studied in pregnant juments . 
no negative effect on pregnancy , parturition and the offspring of juments has been observed after vaccination at different stages of gestation . 
the efficacy of Equilis Prequenza Te was studied during several studies in conditions laboratory and on the terrain . 
for reasons éthiques , no stimulation ( infection ) animal reproduction have been conducted to tetanus . 
the production of protective levels of antibodies against the ingredients of flu virus following vaccination constituait the main measure of effectiveness of the vaccine . 
in these studies , clinical signs and excretion of influenza virus after infection were compared in animals vaccinated and control animals ( animals not vaccinated or vaccinated with a product concurrent ) . 
for the production of tétanos protective levels of antibodies against the toxoïde tétanique constituait the main measure of effectiveness of the vaccine . 
what benefit by Equilis Prequenza Te shown during the studies ? 
the chevaux developed protective levels of antibodies two weeks after the vaccination schedule . 
the duration of protection was five months after primary vaccination and 12 month after the first booster as regards the flu équine , and 17 months after primary vaccination and 24 months after the first booster tetanus . 
what is the risk associated with Equilis Prequenza Te ? 
swelling ( a maximum diameter 5 cm ) taking a partitions , lasts or capsule , may occur at the injection site . 
the swelling is censé reduce within two days afterwards . 
occasionally , pain may occur at the injection site , and in certain cases , an increase in body temperature may be observed for one day even exceptionally for a maximum of three days .

what Equilis StrepE ? 
Equilis StrepE is a vaccine containing the strain vivante mutante délétée of the bacteria Streptococcus equi as active substance . 
it contains nor adjunctive nor preservative . 
Equilis StrepE is supplied as a oral ( vaccine lyophilisé ) to reconstitute in a suspension for injection . 
the vaccine is supplied with the solvent , a applicateur and syringe with a needle . 
it is the first vaccine against the gourme to be authorised for chevaux in the European Union . 
what is StrepE Equilis used ? 
Equilis StrepE is used for the of chevaux immunisation against disease caused by the bacteria respiratory Streptococcus equi . 
this condition frequently and highly contagieuse due to this bacteria called gourme is common . 
this condition engendre such swollen lymph glands present in head of animals as it can cause neuromuscular respiratory tract and therefore a difficulty breathing . 
this condition is infection bacterial frequently and highly contagieuse in the cheval . 
Equilis StrepE reduces the signs of disease , as well as Activity-neutralizing abscesses ( accumulation of pus ) at lymph glands . 
how Equilis StrepE agit-t-il ? 
Equilis StrepE is a vaccine . 
vaccines work by teaching &apos;the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against diseases . 
Equilis StrepE contains small amounts of bacteria called S. equi . 
when the vaccine is given to a cheval , the immune system recognises the bacteria as foreign body and makes antibodies for the fighting . 
in case of new exposure of animals to this bacterium , the immune system will then able to produce antibodies more quickly . 
the strain bacterial inserted into Equilis StrepE has undergone a few changes genetic ( deletion of genes ) , such so that it is develops least easily in the body in animals and has and less likely to cause disease . 
therefore , it is possible use as vaccine . 
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel . 
the vaccine is given as an injection of 0.2 ml inside the the lèvre limit of animals . 
the chevaux included were had no disease in the past , including gourme and had not been vaccinated . 
Equilis StrepE should only be used in healthy chevaux in which a risk of infection higher chance to S. equi is possible , their relevance with chevaux from areas where the imbalance of the bacteria is known . 
what benefit by Equilis StrepE shown during the studies ? 
studies have shown that Equilis StrepE is effective in the active immunisation against Streptococcus equi of chevaux aged 4 months and over and in the atténuation clinical signs and Activity-neutralizing abscess in lymph glands . 
after administration of Equilis StrepE , was lowered below numbers of animals touchés by symptoms of the gourme . 
there was also observed numbers below of abscess and lymph glands touchés . 
what is the risk associated with Equilis StrepE ? 
only of healthy chevaux with a risk of infection may receive this vaccine . 
swelling is up at the site of injection into the four hours after vaccination and the area where the product has been injected may be painful even in monter room . 
reaction is its maximum within two or three days following the injection , but the area touchée should not exceed one surface of more than 3 cm by 8 cm . 
the swelling should disappear in all three weeks and is not expected to have impact on appetite of animals nor cause discomfort . 
in very rare cases , an abscess associated discharge is possible at the site of injection and lymph glands of head may gonfler and cause pain during any time . 
an increase in body temperature up to 2 C is possible the day of the vaccine . 
in rare cases , loss of appetite , fever and chills may be observed . 
in very rare cases , symptoms of depression are possible .

the vaccine is available as a suspension for injection . 
what is Te Equilis used ? 
Equilis Te is used to be vaccinated the chevaux from the age of six months against tetanus , in order to avoid mortality . 
tetanus is a acute infection , often fatal , due to the neurotoxine produced by the bacteria Clostridium tetani . 
this disease , which is develops often from sores contaminées , characterised by a ( rigidity stiffness ) general and muscle spasms convulsifs . 
the cheval account among the species the more sensitive to tétanos . 
the vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection ( injection into a muscle ) . 
the chevaux receive a first vaccination ( primovaccination ) consisting of two injections administered at an interval of four weeks . 
for maintain protection against tetanus , chevaux should receive of rappels . 
the first booster dose should be performed at later 17 months after the primovaccination . 
then , an interval maximum of two years is recommended . 
how Equilis Te to work ? 
Equilis Te contains the purified tétanique toxoïde . 
the toxoïde is a toxine affected to supprimer its , toxic effects any in conservant its antigéniques properties . 
vaccines work by apprenant at immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against the diseases . 
when the product is administered to a cheval , it helps the immune system of animals to react more quickly when it is exposed to the bacteria naturally Clostridium tetani . 
this helps to protect animals against tetanus . 
this vaccine also contains an adjuvant &apos; to stimulate a better response . 
how has Equilis Te been studied ? 
the safety of Equilis Prequenza Te was studied during several studies in conditions laboratory and on the terrain in a many chevaux , aged between two months and older . 
all studies were conducted with Equilis Prequenza Te ( commentaire : repeat ; mentioned in section following ) . 
it was conclu that the product was well tolerated by the chevaux irrespective of their age . 
Equilis Prequenza Te has also been studied in the pregnant juments .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : product anti-inflammatory and anti-rhumatismal not steroids , ATC ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the firocoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) group of Coxibs , acting by selective inhibition prostaglandin synthesis the induced cyclooxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
the cyclo-oxygénase is responsible for the formation of prostaglandins . 
it was shown that the COX-2 is the predominant enzyme of induced a stimulus cytokines and that would be the major responsible for the synthesis prostanoïdes mediators of pain , inflammation and fever . 
the Coxibs have therefore analgesics properties , anti-inflammatory medicines and antipyrétiques . 
the concentration of firocoxib 50 necessary to inhibit the activity of the enzyme COX-2 ( CI50 ) is 0,0369 to 0,12 M , whereas the CI50 of the COX-1 is 20,14 to 33,1 M. 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
after oral administration in the cheval to the dose should be 0.1 mg per kilogram body weight , the firocoxib vif is rapidly absorbed and maximum plasma concentration is reached 3.9 ( 4,4 ) hours ( Tmax ) . 
the elimination half-life ( t ) after a single dose is 29,6 ( 7.5 ) hours and 50,6 hours after 14 days . 
the binding of firocoxib plasma protein binding is approximately 97 . 
after oral administration of multiple doses , steady state is achieved after about to the 8ème daily dose . 
the firocoxib is mainly metabolised by désalkylation and glucurono-conjugaison in the liver . 
elimination red by the excreta ( mainly the urine ) and also by biliary excretion .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Form : gonadolibérine group . 
ATC code vet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the azagly-nafaréline is a synthetic analogue of the gonadoréline ( GnRH ) . 
the GnRH is produced by the neurones of the hypothalamus in all species of vertébrés . 
it controls the reproduction of poissons in modulating secretion of gonadotrophines hypophysaires lutéinisante , the hormone ( LH ) and folliculostimulante hormone ( FSH ) , also known as endocrinologie of poisson , respectively under the name of GtH-II and GtH-I . 
the analogues of GnRH are pharmaceuticals . 
the azagly-nafaréline like other analogues of GnRH , simule the action of the GnRH , in modulating secretion of LH and FSH in the mammalian and poissons . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the azagly-nafaréline is rapidly absorbed after injection intra-péritonéale in the truite arc-en-ciel . 
the distribution and the metabolism of the azagly-nafaréline have not been studied in the species revendiquées . 
the azagly-nafaréline is rapidly cleared from plasma after injection intra-péritonéale , in the truite arc-en-ciel . 
the elimination half-life ( T1 / 2 ) and the mean residence time ( TMR ) in the azagly-nafaréline truite after treatment intrapéritonéal 32 g / kg P. V. are by 4.9 h and 6.8 h .

Pharmaceutical FORM 
implant . 
the implant Gonazon is a implant solid , off-white , 14x3x1 mm . 
information CLINIQUES 
species Target 
dogs ( chiennes ) 
instructions for use spécifiant the species Target 
the following ovarienne function of the chienne by inhibiting the gonadotrophines protracted synthesis . 
Contre-indications 
do not use in the chiennes ( pré-pubères or adults ) help to reproductive ( see section MI ) . 
special warnings precautions 
based on data collected in clinical trials of terrain , implant may , in a small proportion of chiennes treated ( 1.2 ) , be rejeté . 
if the implant cannot be senti to the palpation in the month after administration , it is recommended to propriétaire of animals taking advice not father a vétérinaire , efficacy cannot , in such cases , be ensured . 
at the end of the first year of treatment , it may not be possible , in 10 , localiser and remove the implant . 
to minimize this problem , it is recommended to take care that the implant either well administered subcutaneously , particularly in dogs have deposits of extra-abdominal fat mass . 
the impossibilité of localiser and remove the implant advises inquiétants no effects on the health of dog . 
however , the time of return in warmth do may be safely predicted by treatment . 
the initial flush after single administration in the adult chiennes were , in a wide proportion ( 68 ) not ovulatoires . 
in addition , after treatment repeated , the time of return in warmth cannot be determined with . 
there are no data available on the repeated treatment in the chiennes pre- pubères . 
7 / 36 THE accidental ingestion of the implant by a dog no health affect its , as the oral bioavailability of the GnRH agonists is very low . 
4.5 precautions for use . 
special precautions for use in animals 
treatment in proœ supprimera strus do not flush ongoing ( proœ strus and reports strus ) . 
in the absence of clinical information , do not treat chiennes under 3 kg and chiennes of races géantes than 45 kg . 
in females adults , flush induites are usuellement observed in the first month after the first administration of the implant . 
the frequency of flush induites is lower when the first treatment is administered as métœ strus ( 32 ) rather than anœ strus ( 84 ) . 
therefore , the first treatment should be given preferably in métœ strus . 
the incidence of flush induites after administration of a new treatment to chiennes who did not show signs status strus previous following the administration of the medicinal product is estimated to be very low ( 8 ) . 
the risk of induction of flush fertiles is low in métœ strus ( 5 ) . 
administration of Gonazon to other stages cycle may result in flush may be fertiles . 
if a gets at chienne after flush induites , there may be resorption / and spontaneous . 
therefore , if females is sight in flushes , any contact with male should be avoided until the clearance of any evidence of flush ( swelling vulvaire , bleeding and attraction male ) . 
the flush induites are not observed if treatment is initiated before the puberty . 
in addition , the frequency of flush induites was smaller in young female more than in the elderly . 
some of chiennes with of flush induites may the develop a pseudogestation . 
however , after terrain trials , the frequency of pseudogestations in females treated is not higher than in controls females ( treated ) . 
the product administered at the recommended dose is effective in the elderly chiennes 7 years and older . 
special precautions for to take by the person which by the medicine to vétérinaire animal 
people manipulant the product should use of gloves . 
avoid self-injection sticks . 
in case of auto-administration sticks the implant , consult a doctor immediately and show them the leaflet or on the label of the product . 
side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
due to their pharmacological activity ( inhibition of the production of anabolic sexuels ) administration of the GnRH agonists may cause vaginites in the chienne . 
use in case of gravidité , or ponte lactation 
the use of product is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation . 
laboratory studies showed that it was unlikely that the administration of the medicinal product during the first phase of gestation affect this no gestation ( pregnancy is performed term with being born of chiots viables ) . 
laboratory studies , during , chiennes received concurrently 3 implants during 
4.8 Interactions drug and other 
the azagly-nafaréline is a peptide red broken down by the peptidases but not by cytochrome enzymes type system . 
also , interactions are unlikely . 
in a study of laboratory limited , concomitant administration of Gonazon and progestagènes short-acting was well tolerated . 
however , interactions with other medicinal products have not been studied . 
posology and route of administration 
the recommended dose is one implant by chienne . 
the implant may be administered in the chiennes from four months . 
in the chiennes adults , the first treatment should be given preferably in the métœ strus . 
the duration of the following ovarienne function obtained detailed in the table below :

( Standard Deviation ) 
( 24 days ) 
93 days ) 
based on trials terrain , prevention of the eye strus is obtained for 12 months and more in 75 of chiennes adults and 90 in the chiennes pré-pubères treated . 
however , it may be seen that , in the first month following administration of treatment , some of chiennes treated experienced flush induites ( see section 4.5 ) . 
the product , given at the recommended dose is effective in the elderly chiennes of seven years and older . 
in the chiennes including toxicity gonadiques were blocked with Follow during a course of 12 months , a second treatment may be given to continue prevention of the eye strus . 
there are no data available on animals treated over two times . 
Gonazon should be injected subcutaneously in the anterior abdominal wall , in the area of the ombilic , using special of aseptic . 
the method of administration is as follows : 
put the chienne on back . 
prepare aseptiquement a small area ( e.g. 
4 cm2 ) in the area abdominal wall / ombilicale . 
open the sachet using the incision prédécoupée to remove the injection device sterile . 
remove the needle cover . 
at the difference in injections of liquid , it is not necessary to remove the air bubbles , as this may déplacer the implant of the needle . 
with warning of aseptic for , pincer a small morceau of skin in the area ombilicale . 
the biseau of the syringe upwards , insert the needle into the skin tight angle with a 30 , a single movement as Tissue . 
care to avoid from entering the musculature abdominal wall or into the tissue fatty foods. . 
with your free hand , use your thumb to keep the injection device in place and push the trocart most far possible . 
this repousse the needle , then the removing , leaving the implant under the skin . 
Oter the needle from the skin . 
ensure that the site of administration and sec. clean 
tell the propriétaire should of kept the and administration site clean dry for 24 hours .

tell the propriétaire of kept the and administration site clean dry for 24 hours . 
overdose ( symptoms driving emergency , antidotes ) , if necessary 
the risk of overdose is negligible for this type of formulation and administration ( single administration of a implant subcutaneously ) . 
coadministration of five implants during one year was well tolerated . 
time waiting 
not applicable . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
ATC code vet : 
the azagly-nafaréline , a agoniste of GnRH , has a biphasiques effects on the hypophyse when it is given in continued . 
initially , it stimulates adenoma function and the secretion of LH gonadotrophines ( Luteinising Hormone ) and FSH ( Follicle Stimulating Hormone ) . 
this phase short causes flush induites within one to four weeks after the first administration of the implant ( see section 4.5 ) . 
administration of long exhibit a désensibilisation hypophyse to the effects of GnRH , entrainant suppression the secretion of LH and FSH by the hypophyse . 
therefore , there was no growth folliculaire ( therefore not status strus observed ) and not . 
a switch of the phase of stimulation towards that inhibition is effectif in approximately 1 month . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
absorption : after single administration of a implant subcutaneously to a dog ( approximately 10 kg ) maximal serum concentrations ( 0.13 g / ml ) of azagly-nafaréline are achieved in approximately 3.5 hours . 
after this peak concentrations of azagly-nafaréline , a slow décroissance circulating concentrations of azagly-nafaréline , lasting up to 12 months is observed . 
distribution : the apparent volume of distribution of azagly-nafaréline after intravenous administration to a twice dose contents of a implant is 0,12 l / kg . 
metabolism and excretion : clearance of the azagly-nafaréline after intravenous administration of the same dose is 0.46 l / h and the elimination half-life is 1.8 hours .

treatment in proœ supprimera strus do not flush ongoing ( proœ strus and reports strus ) . 
in females adults , flush induites are usuellement observed in the first month after the first administration of the implant . 
the frequency of flush induites is lower when the first treatment is administered as métœ strus ( 32 ) rather than anœ strus ( 84 ) . 
therefore , the first treatment should be given preferably in métœ strus . 
the incidence of flush induites after administration of a new treatment to chiennes who did not show signs status strus previous following the administration of the medicinal product is estimated to be very low ( 8 ) . 
the risk of induction of flush fertiles is low in métœ strus ( 5 ) . 
administration of Gonazon to other stages cycle may result in flush may be fertiles . 
if a gets at chienne after flush induites , there may be resorption / and spontaneous . 
therefore , if females is sight in flushes , any contact with male should be avoided until the clearance of any evidence of flush ( swelling vulvaire , bleeding and attraction male ) . 
the flush induites are not observed if treatment is initiated before the puberty . 
in addition , the frequency of flush induites was smaller in young female more than in the elderly . 
some of chiennes with of flush induites may the develop a pseudogestation . 
however , after terrain trials , the frequency of pseudogestations in females treated is not higher than in controls females ( treated ) . 
the product administered at the recommended dose is effective in the elderly chiennes 7 years and older .

35 / 36 A the end of the first year of treatment , it may not be possible , in 10 , localiser and remove the implant . 
to minimize this problem , it is recommended to take care that the implant either well administered subcutaneously , particularly in dogs have deposits of extra-abdominal fat mass . 
the impossibilité of localiser and remove the implant advises inquiétants no effects on the health of dog . 
however , the time of return in warmth do may be safely predicted by treatment . 
the initial flush after single administration in the adult chiennes were , in a wide proportion ( 68 ) , not ovulatoires . 
in addition , after treatment repeated , the time of return in warmth cannot be determined with . 
there are no data available on the repeated treatment in the chiennes pre- pubères . 
the accidental ingestion of the implant by a dog no health affect its , as the oral bioavailability of the GnRH agonists is very low .

Halocur comes under the oral solution is clear and yellow . 
what is Halocur used ? 
Halocur is indicated for the veaux neonates in prevention or reduction of diarrhoea due to a body called Cryptosporidium parvum . 
it is a parasite belonging to the group of protozoal , which envahit the digestive system and causes diarrhoea . 
in all cases , Halocur is administered at veau orally , after the meal ( and not to animals whose stomach is empty ) once a day for seven consecutive days . 
how Halocur to work ? 
the active substance of Halocur , lactate of halofuginone , prevents the growth of Cryptosporidium parvum . 
it also prevents the formation of oocystes , which is form covalent to a certain stage cycle life-expectancy of parasite and are excreted ( eliminated ) in the faeces , this helps to transmission of the disease to other animals . 
the primary evidence clinical infection to Cryptosporidium parvum is diarrhoea . 
the mechanism of action precise the halofuginone is unknown . 
how has Halocur been studied ? 
several trials on the terrain were involving in veaux of a élevages . 
in a trial , the veaux provenaient 40 élevages . 
it has been shown that the recommended dose of Halocur orally for 7 consecutive days , in veaux aged 4 to 10 days , reduces the 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel . 
another study in veaux aged 24 to 48 hours demonstrated that Halocur prevents diarrhoea due to Cryptosporidium parvum , compared to placebo . 
what benefit by Halocur shown during the studies ? 
it has been shown that treatment with Halocur reduces the excretion of Cryptosporidium parvum by the veaux and reduces the diarrhoea . 
it has also been shown that it prevents the diarrhoea after 11 days of treatment . 
these studies comparaient treatment with Halocur to placebo . 
it has been shown that the efficacy of treatment is optimisée when it is given subcutaneously , within 24 at 48 hours after the tacrolimus . 
what is the risk associated with the use of Halocur ? 
toxicity symptoms may occur if Halocur is administered to two times the recommended dose . 
these symptoms may include : diarrhoea , presence of blood up in the faeces , decreased eating milk , dehydration , Apathy ( absence of reaction , weakness and prostration ) . 
Halocur should not be administered in the event of diarrhoea installée since more than 24 hours and in animals low . 
Halocur should be administered after the meal . 
before you to take precautions to by the person which by the medicine or contacts with animals ? 
in the user , contact repeated with Halocur may cause allergies skin . 
the utilisateurs of the product should avoid contact with skin and eyes ; contact , they should flush méticuleusement the area exposed to water clear . 
if irritation ocular treatment , it should be arrange an medical advice . 
it is recommended for use of gloves protective handle the product and wash your hands after use . 
Halocur should not be déversé within During water because this could put threatening the poissons and other pathogens aquatiques . 
all medicines vétérinaires or material derivatives these medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations .

days . 
long faut-il wait until the milk of animals could be used for the human consumption ? 
do not if despite , since the product is to be used in the veaux neonates . 
why has Halocur been approved ? 
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human vétérinaire ( CVMP ) concluded that the benefits of Halocur are greater than its risks for the prevention and reducing diarrhoea due to Cryptosporidium parvum in neonates veaux . 
they recommended that Halocur receives a marketing authorisation . 
the benefit-risk balance may be consulted in Module 6 of this EPAR .

what is Ibaflin used ? 
it is also indicated in dogs for the treatment of acute infections not compliquées due to strains sensitive of Staphylococci , Proteus , Enterobacter , E. coli and Klebsiella . 
Ibaflin should be given orally . 
dogs are treated with the tablets , except for infections dermiques , for which the silica gel lyophilisate may be used in addition to the tablets of strength appropriate . 
the chats are treated with the silica gel lyophilisate to 3 . 
the dose and duration of treatment depend on the nature and severity of infection , as well as the weight and unknown of animals treated , and its treatment response . 
the usual dose is 15 mg per kilogram body weight once daily for the shelf exactly as your vétérinaire . 
for more information , see the Package Leaflet . 
how Ibaflin agit-t-il ? 
the ibafloxacine is an antibiotic of the family of fluoroquinolones . 
it stops DNA gyrase , an enzyme which allows the bacteria to of copies of their DNA . 
this enzyme do is opposite cells that in bacterial and did not in the same function animal cells . 
aid inhibition of DNA gyrase , ibafloxacine prevents the bacteria of produce DNA and blocks the making protein and growth , which causes cell death . 
a strain refractory to a type of fluoroquinolone is also refractory to other limbs of this group . 
the use of the ibafloxacine may lead to an increase in the prevalence of resistant strains unknown in the target , although this risk either least high when of isolated animals are treated with this product . 
the tablets of Ibaflin were tested on dogs to evaluate their efficacy in the treatment of infections dermiques , Stevens-Johnson urinary and breathing . 
the silica gel lyophilisate has been studied in chats on infections dermiques , upper respiratory tract and urine . 
in these studies , the effects of Ibaflin were compared with those other antibiotics ( marbofloxacine , enrofloxacine or amoxicilline / acid clavulanique ) . 
the indication a treatment urinary tract in the chats has not been acceptée . 
the silica gel lyophilisate Ibaflin is indicated in dogs for the treatment of infections dermiques ( pyodermique superficielle and deep breathing , sores , abscess ) . 
in a clinical trial on dogs , the silica gel was as effective as the tablets . 
what benefit by Ibaflin shown during the studies ? 
the tablets of Ibaflin were at least as effective as antibiotics comparators in the treatment of infections dermiques and Stevens-Johnson urinary and respiratory in dogs . 
the tablets and silica gel lyophilisate is are shown a comparable efficacy for the treatment of infections dermiques in dogs . 
the silica gel lyophilisate was also as effective as the antibiotic comparator ( amoxicilline / acid clavulanique ) in the treatment of infections dermiques and upper respiratory tract in the chats . 
in contrast , the results were insufficient to used to support the use of Ibaflin in the treatment urinary tract in the chats . 
what is the risk associated with Ibaflin ? 
diarrhoea , ramollissement of faeces , vomiting , Apathy ( absence sensitivity ) and anorexia ( loss of appetite ) are rarely observed in dogs and chats treated with Ibaflin . 
was sometimes severe salivation with the silica gel lyophilisate . 
these effects are that and transient . 
before you to take special care with the person administering the medicine or entrant contact with animals ? 
people with shown hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to quinolones should avoid contact with Ibaflin . 
a medical advice should be sollicité in cases of accidental ingestion , especially with a child .
