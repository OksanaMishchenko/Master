pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
inhibitors of recharge of monoamine Oxidase , ATC ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
clomipramine has a wide spectre works by blocking the neuronal recaptage combined serotonin ( 5HT ) and noradrenaline . 
therefore , it has conjointes properties of the development of recaptage and with an antidepressant tricyclique . 
the active molecules in vivo are clomipramine and its main metabolite , déméthylclomipramine . 
clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine contribute to the activity of Clomicalm : clomipramine is a potent and selective inhibitor of recaptage serotonin 5HT , whereas the déméthylclomipramine is a potent and selective inhibitor of recaptage noradrenaline . 
the mechanism of action primary of clomipramine réside in the effects of serotonin and norepinephrine 5HT in the brain by inhibition of recaptage neuronal . 
in addition , clomipramine has effects antagonist anticholinergiques by its action on muscarinic receptors cholinergiques . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
gastrointestinal absorption of clomipramine administered orally is good ( &gt; 80 ) , in dogs , but the bioavailability of clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine is 22 to 26 due to extensive first . 
peak plasma concentrations occurring of clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine are rapidly ( 1.5 to 2.5 hours ) . 
peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) following a single oral dose of 2 mg / kg hydrochloride clomipramine are 240 nmol / l for clomipramine , and 48 nmol / l for the déméthylclomipramine . 
in repeated dosing of Clomicalm entrainent moderate increases in plasma concentrations , the relationship of accumulation after oral administration twice daily is 1.2 for clomipramine and 1.6 for the déméthylclomipramine , steady state is achieved within 3 days . 
at steady state , the proportion of plasma concentrations in clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine is approximately 3 to 1 . 
when Clomicalm is administered with food , the plasma AUC are slightly higher 25 for clomipramine and 
4 , 8 for the déméthylclomipramine , compared to data of administration in dogs on an empty stomach . 
clomipramine binds extensively to plasma proteins ( &gt; 97 ) in the dog . 
in dogs , the volume of distribution is 3.8 l / kg . 
the major route of the biotransformation of clomipramine is déméthylation in déméthylclomipramine . 
other metabolites polaires come also . 
the half-life of elimination of clomipramine after intravenous administration is 6,4 hours for clomipramine , and 3.6 hours for the déméthylclomipramine . 
the main route of excretion in dogs is biliary ( &gt; 80 ) , the remainder excreted via the kidney .

it is also used in the chat to treat infections urinary caused by certain bacteria . 
how Convenia fonctionne-t-il ? 
the active substance of Convenia is céfovécine which belongs to a group of antibiotics called céphalosporines of third offspring . 
all of these céphalosporines , including the céfovécine , tuent the by preventing the bacteria making their cell wall , which leads to death bacteria and healing infection . 
like other antibiotics , céfovécine is not effective against all types of bacteria . 
data from studies in laboratory on different bacteria have shown that the céfovécine was effective against the bacteria provided in the information product ( SPC ) and Package Leaflet . 
these studies measured the level of healing these infections . 
what were the benefit Convenia during the studies ?

the safety of Convenia has not been evaluated in animals with severe renal impairment . 
a pyodermite is often associated with underlying disease . 
it is therefore recommended to find the underlying mechanism and treat animals accordingly . 
particular attention should be given to patients who have ever had hypersensitivity reactions to the céfovécine , other céphalosporines , pénicillines , or other medicines . 
if an allergic reaction occurs , no other administration of céfovécine should only be performed and appropriate therapy for the allergies to bêtalactamines should be initiated . 
the vétérinaires should be advised that allergic symptoms may recur after when symptomatic treatment is discontinued . 
special precautions for to be taken by people who by the medicine vétérinaire to animals 
the pénicillines and céphalosporines may cause hypersensitivity ( allergy ) to their injection , inhalation , ingestion , or at on the skin . 
hypersensitivity to the pénicillines may lead to reactions croisées with céphalosporines and réciproquement . 
allergic reactions associated with these substances can sometimes be serious . 
do not handle the product if hypersensitivity , or if it has been recommended not to travailler with such preparations . 
the product manipulez carefully when taking warning conseillées to avoid exposure .

pharmacodynamic properties 
the céfovécine is a céphalosporine of third offspring that has a wide spectre of activity against the bacteria Gram-positif and Gram-négatif . 
it is différencie there other céphalosporines by its high protein binding and prolonged duration of action . 
as with all céphalosporines , the action of the céfovécine result of the inhibition of the synthesis of your bacterial ; the céfovecine has a bactéricide activity . 
the céfovécine has a activity in vitro against Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella multocida which are associated with infections of the skin in dogs and chats . 
it has also been prouvé that the bacteria anaérobies as Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. alone in abscesses félins are likely to the céfovécine . 
in addition , the céfovécine has a activity in vitro against Escherichia coli which is associated with the urinary tract infections in dogs and chats .

the more small concentration , which inhibits completely growth up of at least 50 of isolates 2 The more small concentration , which inhibits completely growth up of no less than 90 of isolates 3 some of these pathogènes ( e. g . 
S. aureus ) have shown in vitro resistance to the natural céfovécine 4 The clinical relevance of these findings in vitro has not been demonstrated . 
the resistance to céphalosporines result of an enzyme inactivation ( production de-lactamase ) , a reduction in the permeability by mutations of porines or change in the transporter , or séléction of low affinités for penicillin . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be sent if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
a cross-resistance with other céphalosporines and other béta-lactamines may be observed . 
in appliquant concentration critique microbiological suggested of S 2 g / ml , no resistance to the céfovécine has not been detected in the isolates terrains of Pasteurella multocida and Fusobacterium spp . 
in appliquant concentration critique microbiological suggested of I 4 g / ml , resistance to the céfovécine in isolates of S. intermedius and Streptococci béta-hémolitique is lower than 0.02 . 
the percentage resistant isolates in E. coli , Prevotella oralis , Bacteroides spp. and Proteus spp. were by 2.3 , 2.7 , 3.1 and 1.4 . 
the percentage of isolates Staphylococci spp. coagulase negative ( e. g. 
S. xylosus , S. schleiferi , S. epidermidis ) resistant to céfovécine is 9.5 . 
the isolates of Pseudomonas spp . , Enterococcus spp . , and Bordetella bronchiseptica are intrinsèquement resistant to céfovécine . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the Céfovécine has of pharmacokinetic properties single with a terminal elimination half-life extrêmemment prolonged half-life in dogs and chats . 
the peak concentrations of 31.9 g / ml were measured in the tissue cage fluid in the 2 days after administration . 
14 days after administration , the mean plasma concentration of céfovécine is 5.6 g / ml . 
plasma protein binding is profound ( 96,0 to 98,7 ) and the volume of distribution is low ( 0.1 l / kg ) . 
the elimination half-life is approximately 5.5 days . 
the céfovécine is primarily eliminated unchanged via the kidney .

what is DEXDOMITOR ? 
DEXDOMITOR contains the active substance dexmédétomidine , which belongs to a group of medicines dotés a action psycholeptique ( sédative ) . 
it is a solution for injection . 
what DEXDOMITOR is used for ? 
it is used in the setting of procedures , i. e. not invasive do not comportent likely through the skin or through an body bleeding , before induction of a general anaesthesia . 
the dose is selected according to the unknown treated , indication , the type of intravenous injection , or musculaire- and administration of other medicinal products . 
in dogs , the dose depends on the body surface area ( calculated on the basis of body weight ) ; in the chat it depends on body weight . 
in dogs , DEXDOMITOR is given by injection into a vein ( intravenously ) or intramuscular use ( into a muscle ) . 
in the chat , the product is administered by intramuscular injection . 
the duration and the depth the sedation and analgésie depends on the dose used . 
the active substance of DEXDOMITOR , dexmédétomidine , is a agoniste receptors alpha-2-adrénergiques . 
since norepinephrine in the maintenance of alertness and éveil , a decrease in its release reduces the level of consciousness , including the sensation of pain . 
in dogs , there was studied at the time of the injections intraveineuses and intramusculaires of DEXDOMITOR . 
DEXDOMITOR has also been compared to the médétomidine , in the indication of préanesthésie in chats devant a general anaesthesia and ketamine , and in the indication of sedation deep of dog , in combination with the butorphanol . 
finally , DEXDOMITOR has been studied as préanesthésie in dogs , before induction of the general anaesthesia . 
what is the benefit with DEXDOMITOR shown during the studies ? 
studies have shown that DEXDOMITOR had as the médétomidine to induction of the sedation and for the analgésie in dogs and chat . 
in the médétomidine , analgésie good or excellent was achieved in approximately 40 to 50 in animals , to support its use in the setting not invasive involving pain mild to moderate . 
DEXDOMITOR was at least as effective as the médétomidine in the induction of the general anaesthetic in the chat , in combination with ketamine . 
DEXDOMITOR has also been evidence of efficacy for the sedation deep of dog in combination with the butorphanol , as well as to the préanesthésie before induction of a general anaesthetic , which helps to reduce the amount of anaesthetic which dogs were needed . 
what is the risk associated with the use of DEXDOMITOR ? 
DEXDOMITOR led to a reduction in heart rate and body temperature . 
in addition , it is observera an increase in blood pressure , which retournera then to normal levels , or even lower than normal . 
in dogs and chats , there can be a reduction in frequency breathing and mucous membranes may become pâles or bleuâtres . 
vomiting may occur 5 to 10 minutes after the injection , or at the time of waking up . 
a tremblement and opacités cornéennes ( tasks general on cornea the liquid part of the oeil devant the pupille ) may occur during the sedation . 
other side effects may occur when DEXDOMITOR is used in combination with other medicinal products . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with the use of DEXDOMITOR , see the Package Leaflet . 
over 2 / 3 EMEA 2006 DEXDOMITOR should not be used in the chiots under the age of six months or chatons aged less than five months . 
before you to take precautions to by people who by the medicine or between contact with the studies ? 
if DEXDOMITOR is auto-injecté accidentally or taken orally , consult a doctor immediately and montrez the package leaflet and the label the doctor . 
however , do not drive , due to the risk of sedation and changes in blood pressure . 
avoid contact with skin , eyes and mucous membranes ( surfaces corporelles humides ) . 
contact , rinse water . 
the use of gloves is recommended that imperméables . 
pregnant women , particularly should be paid to avoid of self-administration . 
people with known hypersensitivity to the dexmédétomidine or to any of the other ingredients must be careful with the use of this medicine . 
why has DEXDOMITOR been approved ? 
the Committee recommended that DEXDOMITOR receives a marketing authorisation . 
the benefit / risk is supplied in modulates 6 of this EPAR .

people with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to the other ingredients of the product should be administered with caution . 
side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
because of its activity 2-adrénergique , dexmédétomidine causes a reduction in heart rate and body temperature . 
the blood pressure will start by increase , and is normalise or reached values lower than normal . 
in dogs and chats , a reduction in frequency breathing may occur . 
because of the vasoconstriction peripheral and venous désaturation in animals , with further a oxygenation blood normal , a pale and / or cyanosis lining may be observed . 
there have been told by a few rare cases of pulmonary oedema . 
vomiting may occur 5 to 10 minutes after the injection . 
some dogs , and some chats may also sick at waking up . 
shaking muscles may occur during the sedation . 
of opacités of cornea may occur during the sedation ( see also section 4.5 ) . 
if you are taking sequential of dexmédétomidine and ketamine , over the range of 10 minutes , chats can sometimes have blockade auriculo-ventriculaire or extra heart beats . 
the effects are to be related to the respiratory bradypnée , a schedule breathing intermittent , hypoventilation and apnoea . 
in clinical trials , the incidence of reports of hypoxaemia was common , particularly in the first 15 minutes after anaesthesia to the dexmédétomidine-kétamine . 
vomiting , hypothermia and cases of nervousness have been reported after this type of administration . 
cases of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia have been reported . 
they may include a sinus bradycardia , auriculo-ventriculaires deep down the first and second degree , discontinuation sinusal , as well as fibrinolysis fibrillation and Supra-ventricular arrhythmia , , and an extra heart beats arrhythmias .

use in the event of gravidité , or ponte lactation 
the safety of the dexmédétomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation in both species Target . 
therefore , its use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended . 
drug-drug and other 
the concomitant use of other central nervous system dépresseurs should lead to an additive effects of the dexmédétomidine , the dosage should , therefore , be adjusted accordingly . 
the use of anticholinergiques with dexmédétomidine should be given with caution . 
administration of atipamézole after the dexmédétomidine reverse rapidly their effects and raccourcit , therefore , the time of recovery . 
in general , the dogs réveillent and tiennent on their pattes after 15 minutes . 
chats : 
due to the concomitant administration of 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg body weight vif intramuscularly and 5 mg / kg ketamine poidsvif , the maximum concentration of dexmédétomidine was grow two , but it is has shown no effect on T max . 
the mean elimination half-life of the dexmédétomidine is passée to 1.6 h and the total exposure ( AUC ) increased by 50 . 
the concomitant administration of a dose of 10 mg of ketamine / kg and 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg can cause fits tachycardia .

posology and route of administration 
this medicinal product is designed to : 
- Chiens : intravenous or intramuscular use 
- Chats : intramuscular use 
this medicinal product is not censé be injected in a few times . 
it is may mix the dexdormitor , butorphanol and / or ketamine in the same syringe their compatibility Form has been demonstrated . 
the recommended doses are as follows : 
dogs : 
the dose for dogs are depending on their surface area . 
the dose is 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area intravenously and 500 micrograms / m2 intramuscularly when the dexmédétomidine is used as a single agent they experience sedation and analgésie . 
the dose should be adjusted to the type of surgery , the duration of the procedure and tempérament of the patient . 
5 The concomitant use of dexmédétomidine and butorphanol results in a sedation and analgésie with the effects appear within 15 minutes . 
the effects on other and analgesics are maximaux 30 minutes after administration. and are maintained , respectively , for up to 120 minutes and 90 minutes after administration . 
there was a waking up abortion within 3 hours . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen significantly reduces the dosage of the agent induction necessary , as well as that of the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia . 
in a clinical study , the dose of propofol and thiopental requested respectively , have been reduced 30 and 60 . 
all anaesthetic agents used for the induction and the maintenance of anaesthesia should be given to such effect escompté . 
an additional clinical study showed that the dexmédétomidine contribuait to a analgésie postoperative 0.5 to 4 hours . 
however , dependent on the duration of a number of variableset a dose of analgesic additional can therefore be given , according to the . 
the following Tables répertorient the corresponding doses on the basis of body weight vif . 
in order to ensure an assay précis when administering small volumes , it is recommended to use a syringe marked .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : psycholeptique , ATC ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the dexmédétomidine is the active substance of Dexdomitor which acts as a cognitive and analgesic in dogs and chats . 
the duration and the depth the sedation and analgésie are dose-dépendantes . 
the maximal effect occurring corresponds to a animals détendu , lying down , and do not respond to a stimulus extérieurs . 
the dexmédétomidine is a potent and selective agoniste receptors 2-adrénergiques , which inhibits the noradrenaline from neurones noradrénergiques . 
the neurotransmission sympathique is inhibited and the level of consciousness decreases . 
the administration of dexmédétomidine may lead to a reduction of heart rate and a blockade auriculo-ventriculaire temporary . 
after an initial increased , blood pressure decrease , reaching normal or elevated slightly lower . 
the frequency breathing can sometimes fall . 
the dexmédétomidine induced also a number of other effects associated with 2-adrénergiques receptors such as : pilo-érection , depression toxicity motor and sécrétoires from the gastrointestinal tract , output and hyperglycaemia . 
it was noted sometimes a slight decrease in room . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the dexmédétomidine is a compound lipophile , it is well absorbed after intramuscular administration . 
the dexmédétomidine is rapidly distributed in the body and franchit easily the haematoencephalic barrier . 
in studies performed in rats , the maximum concentration in the central nervous system is several times higher than the plasma concentration corresponding . 
in the blood , the dexmédétomidine is highly bound to plasma protein ( &gt; 90 ) . 
dogs : 
after intramuscular administration of a dose of 50 micrograms / kg , the maximum plasma concentration of approximately 12 ng / ml is achieved after 0.6 h . 
the bioavailability of the dexmédétomidine reached 60 , the apparent volume of distribution ( Vss ) is 0.9 l / kg . 
the elimination half-life ( t ) is between 40 and 50 minutes . the major biotransformation reactions in the dog are hydroxylation , glucuronoconjugaison and N-méthylation in the liver . 
all metabolites known are their nitrogen- free pharmacological activity . 
the metabolites are excreted principally in urine , and to a lesser extent in the faeces . 
the dexmédétomidine has a high clearance and the removal depends on the hepatic blood flow rate . 
it should therefore be expected to a prolongation of the elimination half-life with experience , or when the dexmédétomidine is given at the same time as other medicinal products influant in the circulation liver function . 
chats : 
the maximum plasma concentration is reached approximately 0.24 h after intramuscular administration . 
after administration of 40 micrograms / kg , the Cmax was 17 ng / ml . 
the apparent volume of distribution ( Vss ) is 2.2 l / kg and the elimination half-life ( t ) of an hour . 
in the chat reactions , biotransformation occurs by hydroxylation in the liver . 
the metabolites are excreted principally in urine ( 51 of the dose ) and to a lesser extent in the faeces . 
as in dogs , the dexmédétomidine has a high clearance and the removal depends on the hepatic blood flow rate . 
it should therefore be expected to a prolongation of the elimination half-life with experience , or when the dexmédétomidine is given at the same time as other medicines that influent in the circulation liver function .

possible SIDE 
because of its activity 2-adrénergique , dexmédétomidine causes a reduction in heart rate and body temperature . 
the blood pressure will start by increase , and is normalise or reached values lower than normal . 
in dogs and chats , a reduction in frequency breathing may occur . 
because of the vasoconstriction peripheral and venous désaturation in animals , with further a oxygenation blood normal , a pale and / or cyanosis lining may be observed . 
there have been told by a few rare cases of pulmonary oedema Post-marketing vomiting may occur 5 to 10 minutes after the injection . 
some dogs , and some chats may also sick at waking up . 
shaking muscles may occur during the sedation . 
if you are taking sequential of dexmédétomidine and ketamine , over the range of 10 minutes , chats can sometimes have blockade auriculo-ventriculaire or extra heart beats . 
the effects are to be related to the respiratory bradypnée , a schedule breathing intermittent , hypoventilation and apnoea . 
in clinical trials , the incidence of reports of hypoxaemia was common , particularly in the first 15 minutes after anaesthesia to the dexmédétomidine-kétamine . 
vomiting , hypothermia and cases of nervousness have been reported after this type of administration . 
cases of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia have been reported .

- Chats : intramuscular use 
this medicinal product is not intended for several injections . 
it is may mix the dexdormitor , butorphanol and / or ketamine in the same syringe their compatibility Form has been demonstrated . 
the recommended doses are as follows : 
dogs : 
the dose for dogs are depending on their surface area . 
the dose is 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area intravenously and 500 micrograms / m2 intramuscularly when the dexmédétomidine is used as a single agent they experience sedation and analgésie . 
when this medicinal product is given with butorphanol ( 0.1 mg / kg ) for the sedation and analgésie DVTs ) , the dose intramuscular is 300 micrograms / m2 of body surface area . 
the dose of the dexmédétomidine in premedication regimen is 125- 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area administered 20 minutes before induction of procedures in requiring anaesthetic . 
the dose should be adjusted to the type of surgery , the duration of the procedure and tempérament of the patient . 
the concomitant use of dexmédétomidine and butorphanol results in a sedation and analgésie with the effects appear within 15 minutes . 
the effects on other and analgesics are maximaux 30 minutes after administration and are maintained , respectively , for up to 120 minutes and 90 minutes after administration . 
there was a waking up abortion within 3 hours . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen significantly reduces the dosage of the agent induction necessary , as well as that of the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia . 
in a clinical study , the dose of propofol and thiopental requested respectively , have been reduced 30 and 60 . 
all anaesthetic agents used for the induction and the maintenance of anaesthesia should be given to such effect escompté . 
an additional clinical study showed that the dexmédétomidine contribuait to a analgésie postoperative 0.5 to 4 hours . 
however , dependent on the duration of a number of variablesune dose of analgesic additional can therefore be given , according to the . 
the following Tables répertorient the corresponding doses on the basis of body weight vif .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
macrolides , ATC ATCvet : 
QJ01FA94 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the tulathromycine is an antibiotic semi-synthetic family of macrolides from a fermentation process . 
it is différencie of many other macrolides by a prolonged duration of which is part due to its 3 groups that is , therefore it part of the sous-classe of triamilides . 
the macrolides are antibiotics , which have an activity bacteriostatic , they inhibit biosynthèse protein on their binding selective to RNA bacterial ribosome . 
they act in stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-ARNt and ribosome during the process of translocation . 
4 The tulathromycine has an in vitro activity on Mannheima haemolytica , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Haemophilus parasuis the bacteria pathogènes most commonly seen in the conditions respiratory bovines and porcines respectively . 
increased values of CMI was trouvée for some isolates Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae . 
the tulathromycine was also a activity in vitro against Moraxella bovis virus bactérien , which is the most commonly taken together with the kératoconjonctivite infectious bovine ( KCIB ) . 
resistance MLSB may be constitutive or inductible . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be transférable if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
in the bovins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and a slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.5 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after dosing ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in the lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
one large accumulation of the tulathromycine within neutrophils and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of the tulatromycine in vivo at the site of infection in the lungs is not known . 
peak concentrations are followed by a slow of systemic exposure ( T ) with a mean apparent elimination of 90 hours in plasma . 
plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration is 11 l / kg . 
the bioavailability of the tulathromycine after subcutaneous administration in the bovins is approximately 90 . 
in the porcins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following an intramuscular administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid also absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and a slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.6 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after dosing ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in the lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
one large accumulation of the tulathromycine within neutrophils and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of the tulatromycine in vivo at the site of infection in the lungs is not known . peak concentrations are followed by a slow of systemic exposure ( T ) with a half-life of elimination apparent 91 hours in plasma . 
plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration is 13.2 l / kg . 
the bioavailability of the tulathromycine following an intramuscular administration in the porcins is approximately 88 .

further INFORMATION 
the tulathromycine is an antibiotic semi-synthetic family of macrolides from a fermentation process . 
it is différencie of many other macrolides by a prolonged duration of which is part due to its 3 groups that is , therefore it part of the sous-classe of triamilides . 
the macrolides are antibiotics , which have an activity bacteriostatic , they inhibit biosynthèse protein on their binding selective to RNA bacterial ribosome . 
they act in stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-ARNt and ribosome during the process of translocation . 
the tulathromycine has an in vitro activity on Mannheima haemolytica , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Haemophilus parasuis the bacteria pathogènes most commonly seen in the conditions respiratory bovines and porcines respectively . 
increased values of CMI was trouvée for some isolates Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae . 
the tulathromycine was also a activity in vitro against Moraxella bovis virus bactérien , which is the most commonly taken together with the kératoconjonctivite infectious bovine ( KCIB ) . 
resistance MLSB may be constitutive or inductible . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be transférable if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
in the bovins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and a slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.5 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after dosing ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in the lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
one large accumulation of the tulathromycine within neutrophils and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of the tulatromycine in vivo at the site of infection in the lungs is not known . 
peak concentrations are followed by a slow of systemic exposure ( T ) with a mean apparent elimination of 90 hours in plasma . 
plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( Vss ) determined after intravenous administration is 11 l / kg . 
37 The bioavailability of the tulathromycine after subcutaneous administration in the bovins is approximately 90 . 
in the porcins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following an intramuscular administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid also absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and a slow elimination .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
medicines otologiques Association corticosteroids and antiinfectieux ATC ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the medicine vétérinaire is a fixed combination three principes active ( corticosteroid , antifungal and antibiotic ) . 
4 / 20 THE acéponate of hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid to a class of diésters which has activity intrinsic glucocorticoid both which means a reduction of the inflammation and itching , leading to an improvement in clinical observed in the outer otite . 
the nitrate of miconazole is a synthetic derivative of imidazole with an antifungal activity pronounced . 
the miconazole selectively inhibits the synthesis of ergostérol which is an essential component of the patients in yeast , including Malassezia pachydermatis . 
the mechanism of resistance to azolés consist of an indication of accumulation of the antifungal or a change in the enzyme target . 
no upper sensitivity standardisée in-vitro has not been defined for the miconazole ; however , with the precise methodology used by Diagnostics Pasteur , no strain refractory has not been trouvée . 
the sulphate of gentamicine is an antibiotic bactéricide family of aminoglycosides which works by inhibiting the protein synthesis . 
its spectre of action couvre the bacteria Gram-positives and Gram-négatives such as the following pathogènes germes isolated Ear dogs : 
CMI50 ( g / ml ) 
CMI90 ( g / ml ) 
values CMI ( g / ml ) 
Staphylococcus spp Streptococcus spp Pseudomonas spp Escherichia coli 
8 4 2 
CMI- concentration Minimale Inhibitrice 
since there bacterial strains may be involved in the outer otite dogs , the mechanism of resistance may vary . 
the resistance phénotypes bacterial to the gentamicine if appuient mainly on three mechanisms : changes enzyme of aminoglycosides , failure intracellular penetration of the active substance and alteration of the target range of aminoglycoside . 
the cross-resistance is generally related to pompes to effluent which confèrent resistance aux- lactamines , quinolones and tétracyclines according to the specificity pump compared to substrate . 
there were few bacteria resistant alone of cases of otites canines before treatment ( in accordance with the Ligne directrice CLSI 16 g / ml ) : respectively 2.4 and 13 of Staphylococcus spp . 
( on 122 strains ) and Proteus spp . 
( on 16 strains ) . 
all other species bacterial ( e. g. 
Streptococcus spp , Pseudomonas spp , Escherichia coli ) were susceptible to the gentamicine . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
after instillation of the medicinal product vétérinaire in the led auditif , the absorption of gentamicine in the skin is negligible . 
5 / 20 THE acéponate of hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid to a class of diésters . 
the diésters are ingredients lipophiles which allow a better getting into the skin , associated with a low systemic bioavailability . 
the conversion of diésters in monoéster C17 structures in the skin is responsible for the puissance in the therapeutic class . 
in animals laboratory , acéponate of hydrocortisone is excreted in the same way as the hydrocortisone ( another name of endogenous cortisol ) in the urine and faeces .

side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
administration of Econor to porcs led to the onset of side effects in the European Union . 
the majority of cases reported in 1999-2000 provenaient of Denmark and Sweden ( 1 of Finlande and 1 of Ireland ) . 
in all countries , the incidence ranged from 0.03 to 1.76 . 
in these élevages , the rate of approximately 30 was morbidity and mortality of 1 . 
the porcs who had a hyperthermia , anorexia , and in severe cases the porcs had of incoordination , ataxia and restaient couchés . 
a number of these animals were also swelling or erythema ( postérieurs ) and a oedema palpébral . 
in controlled clinical trials , these side effects have been studied in animals prédisposés . 
mortality was less than 1 but may be due to increased side infections . 
when the occurrence of the side effects , immediate discontinuation of treatment is recommended . 
the porcs sévèrement with should be treated in a environment dry and clean and it should be initiated appropriate symptomatic , including the treatment of concomitant conditions . 
monitoring épidémiologique demonstrated a possible relationship between the prédisposition to side effects and races Landrace Danois and Landrace Suédois as well as early croisements , and this especially in the porcs younger . 
the valnémuline is well acceptée in food but of teneurs than 200 mg / kg aliment may lead to , during the first few days of administration , a transient in nature of food with inappétence .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
antibacterial for systemic use , ATC ATCvet : 
QJO1XX94 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the valnémuline is an antibiotic to the group of &apos;class whose action is inhibition of the initiation of protein synthesis at the ribosome in the bacteria . 
the spectre of action of the valnémuline includes bacteria causing of reached Disorders and Respiratory in the porc . 
the valnémuline is very active against Mycoplasma spp. and spirochètes as Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli . 
6 Mycoplasma 
CMI ( range ) ( g / ml ) CMI 0,0009- 0,125 
50 ( g / ml ) 0,0025

Brachyspira hyodysenteriae Brachyspira pilosicoli . 
Lawsonia intracellularis 
&lt; 2.0 is the concentration of significantly inhibit the intracellular 
the activity of the valnémuline is , in contrast low against Enterobacteriaceae as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
in the porc absorption after administration of a single dose of a substance radiolabelled is greater than 90 . 
a linear relationship has been established between concentration and the dose . 
a slight accumulation was observed after administration of multiple doses but steady state was achieved in 5 days . 
due to an effect of increased plasma concentrations varient according to the method of administration , but the valnémuline is concentre very extensively into tissues , particularly in the lung , and the liver , compared to the plasma . 
five days after the last dose of valnémuline radiolabelled ( a total of 15 ) in the porc , the concentration of liver function was more than 6 times higher than the plasma concentrations . 
the metabolism of valnémuline in the porc is important ; the excretion of the compound or its metabolites occurred primarily by both biliary and 73 -95 of the total radioactivity daily is retrouvent in the faeces . 
the plasma half-life was 1,3-2,7 hours and the major part of the total radioactivity administered was excreted within 3 days and were followed the last dose .

the valnémuline should not be administered in rabbits , as it has toxic effects for this unknown . 
possible SIDE 
administration of Econor to porcs led to the onset of side effects in the European Union . 
the majority of cases reported in 1999-2000 provenaient of Denmark and Sweden ( 1 of Finlande and 1 of Ireland ) . 
in all countries , the incidence ranged from 0.03 to 1.76 . 
in these élevages , the rate of approximately 30 was morbidity and mortality of 1 . 
the porcs who had a hyperthermia , anorexia , and in severe cases the porcs had of incoordination , ataxia and restaient couchés . 
a number of these animals were also swelling or erythema ( postérieurs ) and a oedema palpébral . 
in controlled clinical trials , these side effects have been studied in animals prédisposés . 
mortality was less than 1 but may be due to increased side infections . 
when the occurrence of the side effects , immediate discontinuation of treatment is recommended . 
the porcs sévèrement with should be treated in a environment dry and clean and it should be initiated appropriate symptomatic , including the treatment of concomitant conditions . 
monitoring épidémiologique demonstrated a possible relationship between the prédisposition to side effects and races Landrace Danois and Landrace Suédois as well as early croisements , and this especially in the porcs younger . 
the valnémuline is well acceptée in food but of teneurs than 200 mg / kg aliment may lead to , during the first few days of administration , a transient in nature of food with inappétence . 
if you make other side effects , please tell your vétérinaire .

use in the event of gravidité , or ponte lactation 
no data has been obtained in the chevaux . 
however , studies in laboratory animals have shown effects embryo-foetotoxiques , malformations , mise-bas delayed and a reduction of the survival rate of patients . 
therefore , do not use animals to reproductive , with respect to , or during lactation . 
drug-drug and other 
other NSAIDs , diuretics and substances highly protein bound may lead to competing with the firocoxib and have therefore toxic effects . 
do not be administered in combination with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids . 
a previous treatment with other NSAIDs may lead to the development or aggravation of the side effects . 
it is therefore recommended to see a from treatment with such drugs before instituting therapy with EQUIOXX . 
treatment with molecules simultané to affect the blood flow renal ( e. g. diuretics ) should be done under clinical monitoring . 
any combination of potentially nephrotoxic medicinal products should be avoided due to an increased risk of toxicity in the kidney . 
posology and route of administration

administer 0.1 mg firocoxib vif per kilogram body weight , once a day . 
the duration of treatment varies depending on the response observed but should not exceed 14 days . 
to administer EQUIOXX at a dose of 1000 mg firocoxib / kg , adjust the syringe plunger to oral administration for up to the graduation corresponding to weight cheval . 
each graduation printed on the plunger corresponds to a dose of firocoxib which helps to treat 100 kg vif . 
the contents of a syringe to oral administration may treat chevaux weighing up to 600 kg . 
in order to ensure an assay precise , weight should be determined each of the lowest possible in order to avoid the overdose . 
to ensure that the firocoxib at the appropriate dose , release the knob moletée in the turning a quarter of the glisser and turn the plunger until the graduation corresponding to weight cheval . 
turn the knob moletée a quarter of all and ensure that it is blocked .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : product anti-inflammatory and anti-rhumatismal not steroids , ATC ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) of the group of Coxibs , acting by selective inhibition of the prostaglandin synthesis induced by cyclooxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
the cyclo-oxygénase is responsible for the formation of prostaglandins . 
it was shown that the COX-2 is the predominant of the enzyme induced by a stimulus cytokines , which may be the major responsible for the synthesis of prostanoïdes mediators of pain , inflammation , and fever . 
the Coxibs were therefore analgesics properties , anti-inflammatory medicines and antipyrétiques . 
the concentration of firocoxib necessary inhibition of 50 of the activity of the enzyme COX-2 ( CI50 ) is 0,0369 to 0,12 M , whereas the CI50 the COX-1 is 20,14 to 33,1 M. 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
after oral administration in the cheval at the dose should be 0.1 mg / kg body weight , the vif firocoxib is rapidly absorbed , and the peak concentration is reached in 3.9 ( 4,4 ) hours ( Tmax ) . 
the elimination half-life ( t ) after a single dose is 29,6 ( 7.5 ) hours and 50,6 hours after 14 days . 
the binding of firocoxib plasma protein binding is approximately 97 . 
after oral administration of multiple doses , steady state is achieved after about the 8ème daily dose . 
the firocoxib is mainly metabolised by désalkylation and glucurono-conjugaison in the liver . 
elimination primarily by the excreta ( predominantly in the urine ) and also by the biliary excretion .

what is Gonazon ? 
Gonazon contains the active substance azagly-nafaréline . 
Gonazon has been authorised in the concentrate for solution for injection to saumons and also as implant for dogs . 
Gonazon implant has a rectangulaire , pale off-white , 14x3x1 mm . 
what Gonazon is used for ? 
after anaesthetic , giving an injection into the intraperitoneally in the line with a median , you should 1 / 2 to &lt; 1 length of nageoire on the basis of the nageoire pelvienne . 
the recommended dose of 32 g / kg body weight vif . 
in the chiennes , Gonazon is also indicated for the following function prolonged ovarienne by inhibiting the synthesis of gonadotrophines . 
Gonazon is injected subcutaneously in the area of the ombilic . 
the implant can be given to chiennes from four months ( persistence mean following function reproductrice 12 months ) and up to 6 years of age ( persistence mean following reproductrice function 11 months ) . 
how Gonazon fonctionne-t-il ? 
Gonazon contains the azagly-naféreline , analogue of a natural hormone , the gonadoréline ( GnRH ) . 
the GnRH control reproductive in poissons by increasing the secretion of gonadotrophines on the status ufs . 
in dogs , the administration of a prolonged duration of higher doses of agonistes of GnRH results in the désensibilisation of hypophyse causing suppression release of gonadotrophines and reproductrice function . 
how has Gonazon been studied ? 
in the poissons , Gonazon has been studied in three studies on the Truite arc-en-ciel , two studies on the Saumon atlantique and a study on the Omble Chevalier . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the rate of response to treatment and initiation and synchronisation anticipés the period of fraie . 
the chiennes treated with Gonazon usually did not experienced of flush throughout the study compared to chiennes who had not received treatment . 
the efficacy of the medicinal product has been demonstrated for the prevention of flush and ovulation in chiennes adults up to 7 years for one to two years of treatment . 
data on the recovery of the oestrus , oestrus ovulatoire and fertility added after treatment discontinuation ( i. e. after removing the implant ) were limited , especially for the treatment . 
what were the benefit Gonazon during the studies ? 
in the poissons , the results of studies have shown that Gonazon was effective for induce and synchroniser ovulation . 
in most cases , an effect has been shown to be induced in all 6 to 11 days of treatment and ovulation was generally advanced of 2 to 3 weeks . 
in the chiennes studies have shown that the inserting an implant of Gonazon empêchait the flush and ovulation in chiennes adults up to 7 years for one to two years of treatment . 
what is the risk associated with Gonazon ? 
in the poissons , injection of Gonazon may be associated with a reduction of fertility ( ability to reproduce ) , Quality hen and survival stage oeillé . 
in some cases , it may be due to a use too early Gonazon in the saison of fraie . 
in the chiennes , Gonazon works by inhibiting the production of anabolic sexuels and may be associated with rare cases of vaginite in females prépubaires . 
before you to take special care with the person administering the medicine or entrant contact with the studies ? 
the use of gloves to mix the solution into or handle the implant and avoid yourself . 
in case of accidental contact with skin or eyes , rinse thoroughly with water . 
if the solution into or the diluted solution is renversée on the skin or eyes , or if the implant is auto-injecté by accident , ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice to a doctor immediately and montrez-lui the Package Leaflet and Labelling . 
wash your hands after use of the medicinal product . 
why has Gonazon been approved ? 
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human vétérinaire ( CVMP ) decided that the balance of Gonazon for induction and the synchronisation of ovulation for the production of eye ufs stage oeillé and alevins . 
the implants of Gonazon is effective in the following function ovarienne by inhibiting the synthesis of gonadotrophines . 
the Committee recommended that the CVMP was of the Marketing Authorisation Holder for Gonazon .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
group Form : gonadolibérine . 
ATC code vet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the azagly-nafaréline is a synthetic analogue of gonadoréline ( GnRH ) . 
the GnRH is produced by the neurones in the hypothalamus in all species of vertébrés . 
it controls the reproduction of poissons in modulating secretion of gonadotrophines hypophysaires , lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) and the folliculostimulante hormone ( FSH ) , also known as endocrinologie of poisson , respectively , as GtH-II and GtH-I . 
the analogues of GnRH are pharmaceuticals . 
the azagly-nafaréline , like other analogues of GnRH , simule the action of GnRH , modulating secretion of LH and FSH in and poissons mammalian cell culture . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the azagly-nafaréline is rapidly absorbed after injection intra-péritonéale in the truite arc-en-ciel . 
the distribution and the metabolism of the azagly-nafaréline have not been studied in animal species revendiquées . 
the azagly-nafaréline is rapidly cleared from plasma after injection intra-péritonéale , in the truite arc-en-ciel . 
the elimination half-life ( T1 / 2 ) and the mean residence time ( TMR ) of the azagly-nafaréline in the truite after treatment intrapéritonéal 32 g / kg P. V. are by 4.9 h and 6.8 h .

dogs ( chiennes ) 
instructions for using the Target spécifiant species 
the following ovarienne function of the chienne prolonged by inhibiting the synthesis of gonadotrophines . 
Contre-indications 
do not use in the chiennes ( pré-pubères or adults ) help to reproductive ( see section MI ) . 
special warnings precautions 
based on data collected in clinical trials of terrain , implant may , in a small proportion of chiennes treated ( 1.2 ) , be rejeté . 
if the implant cannot be senti to the palpation in the month after administration , it is recommended to propriétaire of animals of advice not father a vétérinaire , efficacy cannot , in such cases , be ensured . 
at the end of the first year of treatment , it may not be possible , to 10 cases of localiser and remove the implant . 
to minimize this problem , it is recommended to take care that implant is well administered by subcutaneous injection , particularly in dogs have deposits of extra-abdominal fat mass . 
the impossibilité of localiser and remove the implant advises inquiétants no effects on the health of the dog . 
however , the time of return in flushes do can be safely predicted by treatment . 
the initial flush after single administration in the chiennes adults were , in a wide proportion ( CPK ) , ovulatoires . 
in addition , after a treatment repeated , the time of the medicine in flushes cannot be determined with . 
there are no data available on the repeated treatment in chiennes pre- pubères . 
7 / 36 THE accidental ingestion of implant by one dog does not affect the , as the oral bioavailability of GnRH agonists is very low . 
4.5 precautions for use . 
special precautions for use in animals 
the treatment in proœ supprimera strus do not flush ongoing ( proœ strus and reports strus ) . 
in the absence of clinical information , do not treat chiennes under the age of 3 kg and chiennes of races géantes than 45 kg . 
in the female adults , flush induites are usuellement observed in the first month after the first administration of the implant . 
the frequency of flush induites is lower when the first treatment is administered as métœ strus ( 32 ) rather than anœ strus ( 84 ) . 
therefore , the first treatment should be given preferably in métœ strus . 
the incidence of flush induites after administration of a new treatment to chiennes who did not show signs status strus after previous administration of the medicinal product is estimated to be very low ( 8 ) . 
the risk of induction of flush fertiles is small in métœ strus ( 5 ) . 
the administration of Gonazon to other stages of the cycle may cause flush may be fertiles . 
if a chienne gets at after flush induites , there may be resorption / , and spontaneous . 
therefore , if females is sight in flushes , any contact with male should be avoided for up to the clearance of any evidence of flush ( swelling vulvaire , bleeding and attraction male ) . 
the flush induites were not observed if treatment is initiated before puberty . 
in addition , the frequency of flush induites was smaller in young female more than in the elderly . 
some of the chiennes with flush induites may the develop a pseudogestation . 
however , there were terrain , the frequency of pseudogestations in females treated is not higher than in controls females ( treated ) . 
the product administered at the recommended dose is effective in the elderly chiennes of 7 years of age and older . 
special precautions for to be taken by people who by the medicine vétérinaire to animals 
people manipulant the product should use of gloves . 
avoid accidental self-injection . 
in cases of accidental auto-administration of implant , consult a doctor immediately and which show the package leaflet and the label of the medicinal product . 
side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
due to the pharmacological activity ( inhibition of the production of anabolic sexuels ) , the administration of GnRH agonists may cause vaginites in the chienne . 
use in the event of gravidité , or ponte lactation 
the use of the medicinal product is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation . 
laboratory studies have shown that it is unlikely that the administration of the medicinal product during the first phase of gestation does not affect this gestation ( pregnancy is conducted term with develop of chiots viables ) . 
studies in laboratory , during which patients received concomitant chiennes 3 implants for 
4.8 Interactions drug and other 
the azagly-nafaréline is a peptide red broken down by the peptidases but not by the cytochrome P450 system enzymes type . 
therefore , interactions are unlikely . 
in a study of laboratory limited , concomitant administration of Gonazon and progestagènes short-acting was well tolerated . 
however , interactions with other medicinal products have not been studied . 
posology and route of administration 
the recommended dose is one implant by chienne . 
the implant may be administered in the chiennes from four months . 
in the chiennes adults , the first treatment should be given preferably in the métœ strus .

based on studies terrain , the prevention of the eye strus is obtained for 12 months and over in 75 of chiennes adults and 90 in chiennes pré-pubères treated . 
however , it may be seen that , in the first months following the administration of treatment , some of the chiennes treated experienced flush induites ( see section 4.5 ) . 
the product , was administered at the recommended dose is effective in the elderly chiennes of seven years of age and older . 
in the chiennes including toxicity gonadiques were blocked with rate for up to 12 months , a second treatment may be given to continue the prevention of the eye strus . 
there are no data available on animals over two times . 
Gonazon should be injected subcutaneously into the anterior abdominal wall , for the area of the ombilic , using aseptic precautions . 
the method of administration : 
put the chienne on back . 
prepare aseptiquement a small area ( e.g. 
4 cm2 ) in the area abdominal wall / ombilicale . 
open the sachet using the incision prédécoupée to remove the injection device sterile . 
remove the cover of the needle .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
ATC code vet : 
the azagly-nafaréline , a agoniste of GnRH , biphasiques effects on the hypophyse when it is given as continued . 
initially , it stimulates the function of adenoma and the secretion of LH gonadotrophines ( Luteinising Hormone ) and FSH ( Follicle Stimulating Hormone ) . 
this phase short causes flush induites within one to four weeks after the first administration of the implant ( see section 4.5 ) . 
administration of a long time results in a désensibilisation of hypophyse to the effects of GnRH , entrainant suppression the secretion of LH and FSH with hypophyse . 
therefore , it is not growth folliculaire ( therefore not status strus observed ) and not . 
the excretion of the phase of stimulation to that of inhibition is effectif in about 1 month . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
absorption : after single administration of a implant by the subcutaneous route to one dog ( of up to approximately 10 kg ) to maximal serum concentrations ( 0.13 g / ml ) of azagly-nafaréline were achieved in approximately 3.5 hours . 
after the peak concentrations of azagly-nafaréline , a slow décroissance circulating concentrations of azagly-nafaréline , lasting up to 12 months is observed . 
the apparent volume of distribution of azagly-nafaréline after intravenous administration to a dose , equivalent to the contents of a implant is 0,12 l / kg . 
metabolism and excretion : the clearance of the azagly-nafaréline after intravenous administration of the same dose is 0.46 l / h and the elimination half-life of 1.8 hours .

the frequency of flush induites is lower when the first treatment is administered as métœ strus ( 32 ) rather than anœ strus ( 84 ) . 
therefore , the first treatment should be given preferably in métœ strus . 
the incidence of flush induites after administration of a new treatment to chiennes who did not show signs status strus after previous administration of the medicinal product is estimated to be very low ( 8 ) . 
the risk of induction of flush fertiles is small in métœ strus ( 5 ) . 
the administration of Gonazon to other stages of the cycle may cause flush may be fertiles . 
if a chienne gets at after flush induites , there may be resorption / , and spontaneous . 
therefore , if females is sight in flushes , any contact with male should be avoided for up to the clearance of any evidence of flush ( swelling vulvaire , bleeding and attraction male ) . 
the flush induites were not observed if treatment is initiated before puberty . 
in addition , the frequency of flush induites was smaller in young female more than in the elderly .

the ibafloxacine is an antibiotic family of fluoroquinolones . 
it stops the DNA gyrase , an enzyme that allows the bacteria to of copies of DNA . 
this enzyme is found in the cells bacterial and did not on the same in the cells in animals . 
due to inhibition of DNA gyrase , ibafloxacine prevents the bacteria of produce DNA and blocks the making protein and growth , which causes cell death . 
a strain refractory to a type of fluoroquinolone is also refractory to other limbs in this group . 
the use of the ibafloxacine may lead to an increase in the prevalence of resistant strains unknown in the target , although this risk either less high when of isolated animals were treated with this medicinal product . 
the tablets of Ibaflin has been tested in dogs in order to assess the efficacy for the treatment of infections dermiques , Stevens-Johnson urinary and breathing . 
the silica gel lyophilisate has been studied in chats on infections dermiques , upper respiratory tract and urine . 
in these studies , the effects of Ibaflin were compared with those of other antibiotics ( marbofloxacine , enrofloxacine or amoxicilline / acid clavulanique ) . 
the indication relative to the treatment of infections urinary in chats has not been acceptée . 
the silica gel lyophilisate Ibaflin is indicated in dogs for the treatment of infections dermiques ( pyodermique superficielle and deep breathing , sores , abscess ) . 
in a clinical trial in dogs , the silica gel was as effective as the tablet . 
what is the benefit with Ibaflin shown during the studies ? 
the tablets of Ibaflin were at least as effective as antibiotics comparator in the treatment of infections dermiques and Stevens-Johnson urinary and respiratory in dogs . 
the tablets and silica gel lyophilisate is were shown to be an effectiveness similar for the treatment of infections dermiques in dogs . 
the silica gel lyophilisate was also as effective as the antibiotic comparator ( amoxicilline / acid clavulanique ) in the treatment of infections dermiques and upper respiratory tract in chats . 
however , the results were with present to support the use of Ibaflin in the treatment of infections urinary in chats .
