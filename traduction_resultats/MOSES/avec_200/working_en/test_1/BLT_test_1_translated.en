the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
6 The patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in order to assess the response to treatment .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
GONAL-f , in combination with a preparation of lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have severe in LH and FSH . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder must be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent seal . 
in order to avoid the injection of volumes too important , there can dissolve up to 3 ampoules or vials of powder in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 IU or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
in an appropriate therapeutic regimen , it is common side effect with the administration of GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after initiation of therapy with the agoniste , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , be after 2 weeks of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
13 The experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 IU or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use GONAL-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy 
14 males : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
the therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 IU or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to that may be obtained with hMG . 
toxic of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy of the ovaries , plasma levels 
15 high anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques .

multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
16 The patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
GONAL-f , in combination with a preparation of lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have severe in LH and FSH . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
22 GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder must be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent seal . 
in order to avoid the injection of volumes too important , there can dissolve up to 3 vials of powder in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
for example , be after 2 weeks 
23 of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
the experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use GONAL-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
24 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
the therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to that may be obtained with hMG . 
25 Influenza-like of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a marked ovarian enlargement , high plasma levels of anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
26 In patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in order to assess the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
27 clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with GONAL-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of GONAL-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled overstimulation ovarienne , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH . 
however , to date , no particular of malformations have been reported . 
no teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of stimulation of ovarienne .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , ATC code : 
GONAL-f is composed of Hormone Folliculo-Stimulante ( FSH ) produced by cells Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) genetically engineered . 
in women , the most important from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of hair of of Graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe deficient in FSH or LH were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account the imbalance inter-laboratoires changes to the strength of LH . 
in men with deficient in FSH , GONAL-f is given concomitantly with hCG for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , GONAL-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a huitième of the dose of GONAL-f given is excreted in the urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of GONAL-f , steady state is achieved within 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for which the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is omitted , GONAL-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of LH , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity revealed no special hazard for humans , other than those already mentioned in other sections of the SPC . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa an ( &gt; 40 IU / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , and include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 IU / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hMG include urinary . 
however , since GONAL-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data do not have a low clinical relevance .

if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use GONAL-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
35 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
the therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to that may be obtained with hMG . 
36 Influenza-like of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a marked ovarian enlargement , high plasma levels of anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
37 In patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in order to assess the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
38 clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with GONAL-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of GONAL-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled overstimulation ovarienne , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH . 
however , to date , no particular of malformations have been reported . 
no teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of stimulation of ovarienne .

the effects of overdose with GONAL-f are not known , however , the potential occurrence of a syndrome of overstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , ATC code : 
GONAL-f is composed of Hormone Folliculo-Stimulante ( FSH ) produced by cells Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) genetically engineered . 
in women , the most important from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of hair of of Graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe deficient in FSH or LH were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account the imbalance inter-laboratoires changes to the strength of LH . 
in men with deficient in FSH , GONAL-f is given concomitantly with hCG for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , GONAL-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a huitième of the dose of GONAL-f given is excreted in the urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of GONAL-f , steady state is achieved within 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for which the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is omitted , GONAL-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of LH , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity revealed no special hazard for humans , other than those already mentioned in other sections of the SPC . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa an ( &gt; 40 IU / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , and include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 IU / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hMG include urinary . 
however , since GONAL-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data do not have a low clinical relevance .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder must be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent seal . 
43 37,5 IU ( 2.8 micrograms ) may be dissolved in 1 ml solvent and mixed with GONAL-f 75 IU ( 5.5 micrograms ) and / or GONAL-f 150 IU ( 11 micrograms ) . 
up to 3 vials of powder can be dissolved in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
for example , be after 2 weeks 
44 of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
the experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use GONAL-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
45 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
the therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to that may be obtained with hMG . 
46 Influenza-like of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a marked ovarian enlargement , high plasma levels of anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques .

the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
GONAL-f , in combination with a preparation of lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have severe in LH and FSH . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
53 GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
before the first use , the powder must be reconstituted with the solvent seal . 
GONAL-f 1.050 IU / 1.75 ml ( 77 micrograms / 1.75 ml ) should not be reconstituted with other ampoules / vials of GONAL-f . 
the recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of GONAL-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
for example , be after 2 weeks 
54 of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
the experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use GONAL-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
55 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
during the formation of patients with auto-administration , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for use of the pack multidose . 
GONAL-f Multidose to 16 of several injections , instructions unclear should be provided patients , in order to avoid the use of this package vessels multidose . 
because of possible local reactions at the same benzyl alcohol , the site of injection should not be used several consecutive days . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
the therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
56 No clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination of GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to that may be obtained with hMG . 
toxic of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a marked ovarian enlargement , high plasma levels of anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
57 Pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
58 A sperm analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in order to assess the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with GONAL-f . 
GONAL-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of GONAL-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled overstimulation ovarienne , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH . 
however , to date , no particular of malformations have been reported . 
no teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
GONAL-f , in combination with a preparation of lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have severe in LH and FSH . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
before the first use , the powder must be reconstituted with the solvent seal . 
GONAL-f 450 IU / 0.75 ml ( 33 micrograms / 0.75 ml ) should not be reconstituted with other ampoules / vials of GONAL-f . 
the recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of GONAL-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
in an appropriate therapeutic regimen , it is common side effect with the administration of GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after initiation of therapy with the agoniste , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , be after 2 weeks of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
65 In drawn experience of the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use GONAL-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy 
66 in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
during the formation of patients with auto-administration , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for use of the pack multidose . 
GONAL-f Multidose to 16 of several injections , instructions unclear should be provided patients , in order to avoid the use of this package vessels multidose . 
because of possible local reactions at the same benzyl alcohol , the site of injection should not be used several consecutive days . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
the therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
67 suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to that may be obtained with hMG . 
toxic of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a marked ovarian enlargement , high plasma levels of anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
68 Comparé to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in order to assess the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with GONAL-f . 
GONAL-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of GONAL-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled overstimulation ovarienne , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH . 
however , to date , no particular of malformations have been reported . 
no teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of stimulation of ovarienne .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with GONAL-f are not known , however , the potential occurrence of a syndrome of overstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , ATC code : 
GONAL-f is composed of Hormone Folliculo-Stimulante ( FSH ) produced by cells Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) genetically engineered . 
in women , the most important from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of hair of of Graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe deficient in FSH or LH were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account the imbalance inter-laboratoires changes to the strength of LH . 
in men with deficient in FSH , GONAL-f is given concomitantly with hCG for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , GONAL-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a huitième of the dose of GONAL-f given is excreted in the urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of GONAL-f , steady state is achieved within 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for which the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is omitted , GONAL-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of LH , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity revealed no special hazard for humans , other than those already mentioned in other sections of the SPC . 
in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with benzyl alcohol ( 0.9 ) or benzyl alcohol alone ( 0.9 ) caused a mild bleeding and inflammation subaiguë following subcutaneous injection single and changes moderate type inflammatory or dégénératives after single intramuscular injection . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa an ( &gt; 40 IU / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , and include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 IU / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hMG include urinary . 
however , since GONAL-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data do not have a low clinical relevance .

in an appropriate therapeutic regimen , it is common side effect with the administration of GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after initiation of therapy with the agoniste , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , be after 2 weeks of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
76 The experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use GONAL-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy 
77 in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
during the formation of patients with auto-administration , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for use of the pack multidose . 
GONAL-f Multidose to 16 of several injections , instructions unclear should be provided patients , in order to avoid the use of this package vessels multidose . 
because of possible local reactions at the same benzyl alcohol , the site of injection should not be used several consecutive days . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
the therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
78 suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to that may be obtained with hMG . 
toxic of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a marked ovarian enlargement , high plasma levels of anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
79 Comparé to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in order to assess the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with GONAL-f . 
GONAL-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of GONAL-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled overstimulation ovarienne , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH . 
however , to date , no particular of malformations have been reported . 
no teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of stimulation of ovarienne .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with GONAL-f are not known , however , the potential occurrence of a syndrome of overstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , ATC code : 
GONAL-f is composed of Hormone Folliculo-Stimulante ( FSH ) produced by cells Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) genetically engineered . 
in women , the most important from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of hair of of Graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe deficient in FSH or LH were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account the imbalance inter-laboratoires changes to the strength of LH . 
in men with deficient in FSH , GONAL-f is given concomitantly with hCG for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , GONAL-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a huitième of the dose of GONAL-f given is excreted in the urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of GONAL-f , steady state is achieved within 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for which the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is omitted , GONAL-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of LH , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity revealed no special hazard for humans , other than those already mentioned in other sections of the SPC . 
in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with benzyl alcohol ( 0.9 ) or benzyl alcohol alone ( 0.9 ) caused a mild bleeding and inflammation subaiguë following subcutaneous injection single and changes moderate type inflammatory or dégénératives after single intramuscular injection . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa an ( &gt; 40 IU / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , and include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 IU / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hMG include urinary . 
however , since GONAL-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data do not have a low clinical relevance .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
GONAL-f , in combination with a preparation of lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have severe in LH and FSH . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
86 The recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of GONAL-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste or the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
in an appropriate therapeutic regimen , it is common side effect with the administration of GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after initiation of therapy with the agoniste , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , be after 2 weeks of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
87 The experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
during the formation of patients with auto-administration , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to those obtained with hMG . 
toxic of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy of the ovaries , plasma levels 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
90 Patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after starting treatment , as part of the response . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with GONAL-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there is no indication of GONAL-f during pregnancy .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , ATC code : 
GONAL-f is composed of Hormone Folliculo-Stimulante ( FSH ) produced by cells Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) genetically engineered . 
in women , the most important from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of hair of of Graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe deficient in FSH or LH were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account the imbalance inter-laboratoires changes to the strength of LH . 
in men with deficient in FSH , GONAL-f is given concomitantly with hCG for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , the follitropine alfa is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a huitième of the dose of follitropine alfa given is excreted in the urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of follitropine alfa , steady state is achieved within 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for which the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is omitted , follitropine alfa have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of LH , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity revealed no special hazard for humans , other than those already mentioned in other sections of the SPC . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa an ( &gt; 40 IU / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , and include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 IU / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hMG include urinary . 
however , since GONAL-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data do not have a low clinical relevance .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
GONAL-f , in combination with a preparation of lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have severe in LH and FSH . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
96 The recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of GONAL-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste or the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
in an appropriate therapeutic regimen , it is common side effect with the administration of GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after initiation of therapy with the agoniste , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , be after 2 weeks of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
97 The experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
during the formation of patients with auto-administration , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to those obtained with hMG . 
toxic of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy of the ovaries , plasma levels 
the following symptoms may occur during SHO severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
100 Patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including syndrome ovarian polykystiques , SOPK ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the sodium clomifène . 
GONAL-f , in combination with a preparation of lutéinisante hormone ( LH ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have severe in LH and FSH . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l . 
GONAL-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , congénital or acquis , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hCG ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with GONAL-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
GONAL-f is administered subcutaneously . 
106 The recommended dose for GONAL-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary FSH . 
clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for injection containing the urinary FSH . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH , GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of GONAL-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying at the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including SOPK ) : 
the aim of treatment with GONAL-f is developing alone follicule of of Graaf mature from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hCG . 
GONAL-f may be given by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days from menstrual cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37,5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of FSH should not generally not be longer than 225 IU . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant stimulation ovarienne to obtain an folliculaire myeloma before a Fécondation in Vitro or other techniques Assistance Médicale to the Procréation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause the administration of 2.5 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily , beginning the second or third daily cycle . 
in general , an adequate folliculaire development is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a agoniste or the Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) is now commonly used to the peak of endogenous LH and the basal secretion of LH . 
in an appropriate therapeutic regimen , it is common side effect with the administration of GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after initiation of therapy with the agoniste , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , be after 2 weeks of treatment with agoniste , 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
special WARNING THAT THE experience drawn from the FIV shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually lower thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a deficiency in patients with severe LH and FSH : 
GONAL-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised individual response to the individual patient , it is based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 IU lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 IU FSH . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
it may be appropriate in a Rotation prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5.000 to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24 at 48 hours after the last injection of GONAL-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is will recommend then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hCG . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( IIU ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; because the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( LH / hCG ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment qualitative of the body yellow . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hCG should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of FSH lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
GONAL-f should be administered at a dose of 150 IU , up to 3 times per week , concomitantly with hCG , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome utérin incompatible with pregnancy in men : primary testicular failure . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
GONAL-f is a substance gonadotrope both that can cause adverse reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , safe and effective use of GONAL-f requires a Periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of FSH may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose should be used . 
the self-administration of GONAL-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of advice avisés . 
during the formation of patients with auto-administration , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of GONAL-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may be considered as free . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and the potential for contraindications for pregnancy should be investigated . 
tests porteront , particularly in the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques AMP , may be at a hypertrophy or overstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a therapy précise of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in the results of the tests performed therapy . 
clinical studies have shown that the ovarienne sensitivity to GONAL-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of FSH is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days , and in increments of 37,5 or 75 IU . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif GONAL-f / LH with the human gonadotrophines disorder ( hMG ) has not been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f / LH is equivalent to those obtained with hMG . 
toxic of overstimulation ovarienne ( SHO ) 
the SHO is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne make . 
this syndrome can occur at varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy of the ovaries , plasma levels 
109 high anabolic sexuels and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to pleural within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the clinical may relate : in volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , SHO severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes a SHO , except in cases where the hCG is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken in case of overstimulation ovarienne , supprimer administration of hCG and conseiller to patients not to be of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a SHO may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hCG . 
in order to minimise the risk of SHO or pregnancy myeloma , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of SHO and pregnancy myeloma is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair of diameter should 14 mm . 
with the technique AMP , the risk of overstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter greater than or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hCG . 
the risk of overstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy myeloma will be minimisé if it is conforme at the recommended dose of GONAL-f , at therapeutic regimen and , if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the technique AMP , ponction all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of anaphylactic overstimulation . 
a SHO may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , SHO occurs after treatment discontinuation hormone and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 after treatment . 
in general , the SHO régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe SHO , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and treatment of SHO specific should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with a disease of the ovaries polykystiques . 
pregnancy myeloma 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , spectrum an increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural advice , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with GONAL-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy myeloma , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant of techniques AMP , the risk of pregnancy myeloma is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
110 The patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy myeloma before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the case of techniques AMP than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after FIV is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour tract génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations congenital may be slightly higher after AMP after advice spontaneous . 
it is suggested that this is due to SPC parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , sperm characteristics ) and a different in AMP multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with predisposing risk for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of any . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of FSH are indicateurs endogenous of primary testicular failure . 
such patients do not répondront to treatment with GONAL-f / hCG therapy . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after starting treatment , as part of the response . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with GONAL-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there is no indication of GONAL-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled overstimulation ovarienne , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH . 
however , to date , no particular of malformations have been reported . 
no teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies . 
GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of stimulation of ovarienne .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with GONAL-f are not known , however , the potential occurrence of a syndrome of overstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , ATC code : 
GONAL-f is composed of Hormone Folliculo-Stimulante ( FSH ) produced by cells Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) genetically engineered . 
in women , the most important from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of hair of of Graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe deficient in FSH or LH were defined by a plasma levels of LH , endogenous &lt; 1.2 IU / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account the imbalance inter-laboratoires changes to the strength of LH . 
in men with deficient in FSH , GONAL-f is given concomitantly with hCG for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , the follitropine alfa is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a huitième of the dose of follitropine alfa given is excreted in the urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of follitropine alfa , steady state is achieved within 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for which the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is omitted , follitropine alfa have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of LH , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity revealed no special hazard for humans , other than those already mentioned in other sections of the SPC . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa an ( &gt; 40 IU / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , and include fécondité more reduced .

treatment with GONAL-f , SHO has a severe , unless the medicine used to trigger maturation final folliculaire ( containing the choriogonadotropine humaine- hCG ) has been given . 
therefore , in case of SHO , it is recommended not to administer the hCG and do not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods contraceptive mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
the occurrence of a pregnancy myeloma after you have had support the Assistance Médicale to the Procréation is related to the number of ovocytes / embryons transférés .

it contains parts of the ( flu ) viruses that have been inactivées ( tuées ) . 
the vaccine contains a flu strain called A / VietNam NIBRG-14 / 1194 / 2004 ( H5N1 ) . 
the vaccine is the same as Prepandrix , which is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) . 
the company that makes Prepandrix has agreed that its scientific data can be used for this vaccine . 
the vaccine should be given according to official recommendations . 
the vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how to the vaccine is used for ? 
the vaccine is given by injection into the muscle of the upper arm , as two doses , at least three weeks apart . 
how to the vaccine to work ? Prepandemic influenza vaccine ( H5N1 ) ( split whole , inactivated , adjuvanted ) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals is a prepandemic &apos;vaccine . 
this is a special type of vaccine to protect against a strain of flu virus that can cause a future pandemic . 
a flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of flu virus that can spread easily from person to person because people have no immunity ( protection ) against it . 
a pandemic can affect most countries and regions around the world . 
health experts pensent that the next flu pandemic could be caused by the H5N1 strain . 
the vaccine has been developed for apporter protection against it , in order to be able to be used before or during a flu pandemic . 
the vaccine contains small fragments of haemagglutinines ( proteins from surface ) of the virus H5N1 . 
the virus has any first been inactivated ( killed ) so that it does not cause disease . 
in a new exposure to virus , the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly , which may help the body to protect against the disease caused by the virus . 
before use , the vaccine is prepared in mélangeant a suspension that contains influenza virus particles , with a émulsion . 
the émulsion résultante is then the injection . 
the émulsion contains an adjuvant &apos; ( a compound containing oil ) to healing better response . 
how has been studied in the vaccine ? 
the effects of the vaccine were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans . 
the main study of the vaccine enrolling 400 adult healthy and to compare the ability of different doses of vaccine , with or without the adjunctive , to trigger the production of antibodies ( immunogenicity ) . 
the participants received two injections of vaccine containing one of four different doses of haemagglutinine . 
the injections have been performed to 21 days apart . 
the main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies anti-grippe in the blood to three time points distincts : before vaccination , the day of the second injection ( day 21 ) and 21 days later ( day 42 ) . 
other studies have been performed to étayer the main study and for demonstrate the safety of the vaccine . 
what benefit has demonstrated by the vaccine during the studies ? 
according to criteria laid down by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) , a prepandemic &apos;vaccine should induce protective levels of antibodies in at least 70 of people for it to be considered suitable . 
the main study showed that the vaccine measured to 3.75 micrograms haemagglutinine with an add-on to induce a antibody response that met the criteria . 
in 21e day after the second injection , 84 of the people receiving the vaccine had levels of antibodies that would protect against H5N1 . 
what is the risk associated with the use of the vaccine ? 
for the full list of all side effects reported with the vaccine , see the Package Leaflet . 
it is recommended to see vaccination for people with a brusque a fever . 
therefore , the vaccine has been approved ? 
the CHMP decided that the benefits of Prepandemic influenza vaccine ( H5N1 ) ( split whole , inactivated , adjuvanted ) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals were greater than its risks for active immunisation against the H5N1 subtype of flu virus A. 
the Committee recommended that the vaccine receives a marketing authorisation . 
other information about to the vaccine : 
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Prepandemic influenza vaccine ( H5N1 ) ( split whole , inactivated , adjuvanted ) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S. A. on 26 September 2008 .

information from data non-cliniques : 
the ability of the vaccine to induce protection against the homologous and Strains of the vaccine has been evaluated in pré-clinique with inoculations of child-resistant ( challenge ) in the furet . 
in each experience , four groups six ferrets were immunisés intramuscularly with a vaccine adjuvanté with AS03 containing hémagglutinine dérivée with the H5N1 strain / A / Vietnam / 1194 / 004 ( NIBRG-14 ) . 
doses of 15- 5 - 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms hémagglutinine has been tested in experience in the homologous challenge , and doses of 15- 7,5- 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms hémagglutinine has been tested in experience in the heterologous challenge . 
the controls include ferrets immunisés with the adjunctive alone , the vaccine non-adjuvanté ( 15 micrograms of HA ) or with saline solution tamponnée phosphate . 
ferrets were vaccinated to J0 and J21 and challenged route intratrachéale to J49 to a lethal dose of H5N1 / A / Vietnam / 1194 / 004 or H5N1 / A / Indonesia / 5 / 05 hétérologue . 
among those receiving the vaccine adjuvanté , respectively 87 and 96 were applied against the lethal dose homologue or hétérologue . 
the excretion viral at the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in animals were vaccinated compared to controls , suggesting a reduction of the risk of transmission viral . 
in the control group ( with and without adjunctive ) , all animals are morts or have been euthanasiés when they were moribonds , three to four days after initiation of exposure to the lethal dose .

what is HBVAXPRO ? 
HBVAXPRO is a vaccine , it is available as a suspension for injection in vials and pre-filled syringes . 
it contains some parts of the hepatitis B virus as the active substance . 
HBVAXPRO is available in two concentrations ( 10 to 40 micrograms / ml ) . 
what HBVAXPRO is used for ? 
HBVAXPRO is used to be vaccinated against hepatitis B people with a risk of exposure of hepatitis B virus , such as assessed on the basis of official recommendations . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how HBVAXPRO is used for ? 
one vaccination schedule is understand at least three injections of HBVAXPRO . 
the recommended dose for children up to the age of 15 years of age is 0.5 ml concentration of the lower ( 10 microgram / ml ) for each injection . 
for adults and adolescents aged 16 years or older , 1 ml of the concentration the lowest approved is used for each injection . 
the concentration the higher ( 40 micrograms / ml ) is used in patients who are or are receiving dialysis ( undergoing a blood clearance technique ) . 
HBVAXPRO is usually given by injection into a muscle of the thigh in infants and young children and shoulder in children , adolescents and adults . 
the calendar injections depends on the age of the patient , the strength of the immune system response to vaccination and the probability of exposure of hepatitis B virus . 
for a full list of comparison administration , see the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) . 
how HBVAXPRO to work ? 
HBVAXPRO is a vaccine . 
vaccines work by apprenant to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against a disease . 
HBVAXPRO contains small amounts of surface antigens &apos; ( proteins from the surface ) of the hepatitis B virus . 
when a user receives the vaccine , the immune system recognises the surface antigens as étrangers and product antibodies against them . 
the immune system will then 
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. able to produce antibodies more quickly when the person will be exposed to naturally to viruses . 
this helps to protect you against infection with hepatitis B virus . 
this means that they are fixés on of compounds aluminium to induce a better response . 
HBVAXPRO has been developed specifically from a vaccine already used in the European Union , to remove the preservative thiomersal , which contains of mercury &apos; . 
repeated exposure to mercury &apos; from sources of medicinal products and food may result in accumulation in the organs . 
this accumulation may be harmful and is a cause of concern . 
how has HBVAXPRO been studied ? 
as the active substance in HBVAXPRO is already authorised in the European Union , HBVAXPRO has not been studied formelles . 
the company has supplied information on the comparison of other vaccines with and without thiomersal , including studies involving a vaccine that contains the same active substance that HBVAXPRO . 
what is the benefit with HBVAXPRO shown during the studies ? 
the results of studies presented have shown that vaccines exempts of thiomersal induisaient protective levels of antibodies against hepatitis B virus similar to those induced by vaccines containing thiomersal at the end of the vaccination schedule . 
among these vaccines figuraient those contenaient the same active substance that HBVAXPRO . 
what is the risk associated with the use of HBVAXPRO ? 
the most common side effects reported with HBVAXPRO ( in 1 to 10 users in 100 ) are reactions at the site of injection including pain , temporary , erythema ( redness ) and induration ( durcissement ) . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with HBVAXPRO , see the Package Leaflet . 
HBVAXPRO should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients . 
it must not be used in people who have a fever . 
as with all vaccines , if HBVAXPRO is used in grands prématurés , there is a risk of apnoea ( short pauses of respiration ) in infants . 
their respiratory should be monitored for 3 days after vaccination . 
why has HBVAXPRO been approved ? 
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that suppression thiomersal vaccines do reduced not their effectiveness in protection against infection with hepatitis B virus , but to reduce the risk . 
the Committee recommended that a marketing authorisation for HBVAXPRO . 
other information about : 
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for HBVAXPRO to SANOFI PASTEUR MSD SNC on 27 April 2001 .

posology and method of administration 
posology Adults and adolescents ( from the age of 16 years ) : 
1 dose ( 10 g ) of 1 ml for each injection should be used . 
vaccination schedule : 
the full vaccination course must include at least three injections . 
two doses of vaccination schedule can be recommended : 
0 , 1 , 6 months : two injections of one month apart , followed by a third dose six months after the first injection . 
0 , 1 , 2 , 12 months : three injections to one month apart , followed by a fourth dose 12 months after the first injection . 
16 It is recommended to administer the vaccine with respect to any of the diagrams listed . 
the people receiving the schedule at range short ( 0 , 1 , 2 months ) should receive a booster dose to 12 months , to achieve high levels of antibodies . 
a booster dose : 
subjects immunocompétents 
the need for a booster dose in immunocompetent individuals who have had a complete primary immunisation course has not been established . 
however , some of the doses of vaccine local comportent currently a recommendation for a booster dose and they must be respectés . 
subjects immunocompromised ( e. g. patients on dialysis , transplant organ ) 
in individuals with immunodeficiency vaccinated , additional doses of vaccine should be recommended if the titre of antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen of hepatitis B virus ( anti-AgHBs ) is less than 10 IU / l . 
revaccination subjects non-répondeurs 
when patients non-répondeurs after the vaccination schedule is revaccinés , 15-25 of them outcome occur an antibody response after administration of an additional dose and 30-50 after administration of three doses . 
however , due to insufficient data on safety of the vaccine hepatitis B when the number of doses administered excède the number of recommended doses , the revaccination of subjects who have had a complete primary course of vaccination is not systematically recommended . 
the revaccination should be considered for those at high risk , after evaluated the benefits of vaccination and the potential risks of increase of side effects local and disorders . 
recommendations precautions for the known or présumée to hepatitis B virus ( e. g. pricking with a needle contaminated by sewage ) : 
- Administration immunoglobulin anti-hépatite B as soon as possible after exposure ( in the 24 
hours ) . 
- The injection with a first dose of vaccine should be administered within 7 days of exposure . 
it can be given at the same time as the injection immunoglobulin anti-hépatite B , but with an injection site séparé . 
- A control sérologique is also recommended , with subsequent injections of the vaccine , 
necessary ( i. e. by iron sérologique of the patient for a short and protection . 
- In patients who are not vaccinées or incomplètement vaccinées , additional 
should be made according to the doses of vaccine recommended .

in such cases , as vaccination may not prevents not infection with hepatitis B virus . 
some factors may reduce the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines 
these factors include age , the genre males , obesity , tabac , the route of administration and certain conditions sous-jacentes . 
monitoring sérologique should be considered in patients who for which it is the risk of do not reaching the lower limit seroprotection following primovaccination complete . 
additional doses may be considered in people who meet little or no to vaccination . 
the vaccine will not prevent infection caused by the hepatitis A , hepatitis C and hepatitis E or other agents pathogènes known to infecter the liver . 
as with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment should always be immediately available , due to a rare anaphylactic reactions occurring after the administration of the vaccine . 
the vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and thiocyanate potassium used during the making the vaccine .

the findings SCIENTIFIQUES AND MOTIFS FOR MODIFICATION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER ( S ) OF HBVAXPRO PRÉSENTÉS BY THE &apos; EMEA 
HBVAXPRO is a vaccine monovalent provided to the active immunisation against infection caused by all known subtypes of the hepatitis B virus , in all groups âges considered to be at risk of exposure to the virus . 
the active substance in HBVAXPRO , ( recombinant ) vaccine against hepatitis B surface antigen , is of hepatitis B virus ( AgHBs ) , talc and technology . 
HBVAXPRO is a vaccine which induces a specific cell antibody and immune response against the AgHBs , resulting in a active immunisation against infection caused by the hepatitis B infection . 
the benefits of HBVAXPRO are protection effective against hepatitis B in all groups âges in the absence of thimérosal in the product fini . 
problems related to the relatively low immunogenicity component hepatitis B ( HepB ) in vaccines contains the ingredient recombinant hepatitis B produced by SPMSD were assessed and much débattus by the CHMP and its groups of physical work ( Biotechnologie , Vaccins ) . 
the 26 May 2005 , the CHMP decided of réunir a group of experts ad hoc on protection short-term and long-term against hepatitis conférée by vaccines recombinant against hepatitis B. 
the CHMP was interroge on the fact that there is a prouvée variability of the antibody response against hepatitis B not anticipated after vaccination with Hexavac . 
this variability appears to be related to changes currently not contrôlables process making the ingredient of the vaccine technology HepB . 
the interrogations portaient on the immunogenicity of the ingredients of low HepB Hexavac , the potential effect on long-term protection against infection with hepatitis B and booster vaccination , following primary vaccination course with this vaccine . 
during the réunion plénière of January 2006 , the CHMP confirmed its concern regarding the decrease in the immunogenicity of the ingredients technology Hep B in HBVAXPRO and PROCOMVAX . 
the Committee discuté current of a lack of connaissances on the clinical relevance of the findings and immunological memory usually and decided that problems scrupuleusement had to be performed prior to administration of a of réglementation . 
the Committee also seen that the final study in infants less than 1 year has been performed in 2001 . 
therefore , data from up to date should be interpreted with caution because they applies to a paediatric dose ( 5 g ) of the vaccine Hep B product before 2001 . 
it semblerait that the vaccine Hep B currently product is less immunogène that the vaccine produced in the Prograf / Prograft . 
the reason of the decrease in the immunogenicity for several years have not yet been identified . 
it has been decided that decision may be taken as responses eaten to questions about quality and clinical concern . 
13 February 2006 , the European Commission ( EC as amended ) was an open- label study the intended to Article 20 of règlement ( EC as amended ) 726 / 2004 , after the CHMP has expressed its concern regarding the low immunogenicity of the ingredients of HBVAXPRO HepB . 
1 DISCUSSION 
the site of the quality , there are no tools technique , analytique or animals able to predict the immunogenicity of the ingredients recombinant HepB in humans . 
any tools analytiques may be used as endpoints cohérence , but not as corrélats for the safety and efficacy ( immunogenicity ) release HepB drugs with SPMSD . 
however , the new model our advises not no baseline of prévision before have been completely validated and after shown its ability to différencier the Intravenous of HBVAXPRO who achieved a response high of those who achieved a response low during clinical trials . 
although the mechanism first of the decrease in the immunogenicity during the 5 years is not yet clarified , it has been prouvé that the process occur was now better evaluated . 
the TAMM was initiated at the site a process occur improved in order to increase the immunogenicity . 
among data investigated by the CHMP figuraient those 7 studies HBVAXPRO and Procomvax , a is still ongoing . 
these studies have been carried out on a groups at risk and âges groups including children are of mothers positives to hepatitis B , infants , in healthy young adults and in subjects aged 16 to 35 years . 
in studies with the TAMM to date on HBVAXPRO and Procomvax , seuils seroprotection were achieved in the large majority of vaccinated . 
no evidence of the impact on protection short or long-term clinical studies have been identified . 
in addition , a study of clinical performance assessed by protection against the disease , since the note the trial V121-018 , support that vaccines against hepatitis B are helpful to reduce the infection with hepatitis B and its serious sequelae . 
due to the relatively high risk of infection , the group of infants from mothers are positives to hepatitis B represents the population , the most vulnérable to a immunogenicity inadequate possible of the vaccine . 
as there are currently no in an increase in the number of cases acute hepatitis B after vaccination with HBVAXPRO , because of the fact that the EU is an area weakly endémique , no problem safety follow-up there could be identified by the CHMP . 
the results of these trials on the product made in the current facilities confirm of solid performance and reproductibles fondées on these data historiques récentes or also consider of performance comparable among other populations . 
during the not conducted because prior spent , performance high obtained in adolescents and young adults was still been accompanied by a performance high on infants . 
therefore , the results of this study prouvent that the product currently available has been shown to provide the intended to produce its own protection ( antibodies ) in all populations for which it is used . 
the CHMP was entendu with the TAMM on the révision information on the product to all formulations of HBVAXPRO , to be possible the advice and suggestions recommended that in the procedure . 
the SPC and Package Leaflets révisés gave information to day on better use of the medicinal product , because of the last clinical data . 
these changes , normally , respond to the questions soulevées by the CHMP and its groups of physical work . 
the decision of the results of studies , the TAMM was engagé to change the sections 4.2 , 4.4 and 4.5 ( as appropriate ) and 5.1 of the SPC as follows : 
the CHMP was studied in list all techniques and clinical data are available for HBVAXPRO . 
the CHMP concluded that the use of this vaccine has been shown to have no risk follow-up , irrespective of the target to which the vaccine is indicated .

3 MOTIFS FOR MODIFICATION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER ( S ) OF HBVAXPRO 
considérant IS 
the CHMP thinks that information on the product to HBVAXPRO must be modified to make sure the sûreté and efficacy of the clinical use for the following reasons : 
due to a lack of data on the low immunogenicity available to date , the CHMP decided that it is necessary to give other studies in order to ensure , avenir , protection long-term against hepatitis B vaccine with the current ; 
the use of this vaccine no risk follow-up , irrespective of the target to which the vaccine is indicated . 
the potential risks restants will be minimisés to acceptable by changes completely of RPC ; 
the CHMP decided that the balance of HBVAXPRO associated with protection against infection caused by all known subtypes of the hepatitis B virus , in all groups âges considered to be at risk of exposure to the virus , remains favourable . 
the Committee recommended that the Marketing Authorisation Holder for HBVAXPRO soi altered , in accordance with Article 5 , section 2 , règlement ( EC as amended ) 726 / 2004 .

- adults 
- adolescents that souffrir a peptic ulcer . 
this medicinal product is for use diagnosis only . 
posology and method of administration 
this medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional under medical supervision . 
Helicobacter Test INFAI is test breathing to single administration . 
the dose for adults and adolescents from the age group 12 years of age is a pot of 75 mg . 
the patient should be taken on an empty stomach for more than 6 hours , preferably in the night . 
test lasts approximately 40 minutes . 
test should be repeated , it should not be prior to the following day . 
the éradication of Helicobacter pylori could give results positive negative . 
therefore test should only be considered after a minumum 4 weeks of treatment antibacterial systemic and that at the end of 2 weeks after the last dose of agents antisécrétoires acids . 
these two medicines may interfere with the presence of Helicobacter pylori . 
this is particularly important after the treatment of éradication of Helicobacter . 
it is important to adhere to properly the instructions for use described in section 6.6 ( &quot; Instructions for use and handling , and disposal ) without which the validité outcome will be uncertain . 
contraindications 
( posology and method of administration ) . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
test positive alone , it is not an indication of the treatment of éradication . 
a diagnostic différentiel with consider endoscopiques invasive may be necessary to for the presence of other conditions such as peptic ulcer , gastritis autoimmune and malignancies . 
there are insufficient data available on the fiabilité of Helicobacter Test INFAI to recommend use in patients who have had a gastrectomie and in patients aged below 12 years of age . 
for children over three years , the assay INFAI Helicobacter for âges 3 to 11 years of age is available . 
in cases of gastrite-A particuliers ( gastritis atrophique ) , the respiratory test results may give positive positive , therefore other tests may be required to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori . 
in case of vomiting during the course of the test requiring repeat treatment , it should be considered on an empty stomach prior to the following day , but not is documented section 4.2 ( Posology and method of administration ) .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : other diagnostic agents , ATC code : 
no pharmacological activity has been described in the amount of 75 mg of 13C-urée administered by taking during the respiratory test . 
3 Following oral administration , urea branded reached mucosa . 
in the presence of Helicobacter pylori , 13C-urée is metabolised by the uréase of Helicobacter pylori according to the reaction : 
2 H2N ( 13CO ) NH2 2 2H2O 
enzyme uréase 
4NH3 2 13CO2 
the carbon dioxide partitions through the blood vessels . 
then it is carried as bicarbonate up in the lung , and excreted in the form of 13CO2 with the air exhalé . 
in the presence of the uréase bacterial , the proportion of carbons isotopes 13C / 12C affected significantly . 
the amount of 13CO2 in samples respiratory is determined by spectrométrie mass ( IRMS ) and expressed as the absolute differences ( baseline ) at baseline of 00 minute and to 30 minutes . 
the uréase is produced in the stomach only by Helicobacter pylori . 
other bacteria productrices of uréases are rarely present in the flora . 
compared to diagnostics biopsiques of an infection at Helicobacter pylori , the sensitivity of the test breathing , in clinical studies in adult patients , reached 457 96,5 what -CI 97,9 ( CI : 
94,05 -99,72 ) and specificity 96.7 to 100 ( 95 -CI : 
-103,63 ) , whereas in clinical studies in 93 adolescents from 12 to 17 years , the sensitivity of the test breathing reached 97,7 ( 90 -CI : 
91.3 ) and specificity 96,0 ( 90 -CI : 
89,7 ) . 
in the absence of uréase bacterial , the amount of a total of urea administered after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract , will be metabolised as urea endogenous . 
ammonia which released , as described above , with the hydrolysis bacterial is incorporated into the metabolism of NH4 . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the 13C-urée administered orally , is metabolised in the carbon dioxide and ammonia or integrated in the cycle endogenous urea . 
any increased 13CO2 should be measured by isotopique analysis . 
the absorption and the distribution of 13CO2 are more rapid that the effect of the uréase . 
thus , the cleavage of the 13 C-urée with uréase of Helicobacter pylori is Step limitante of full process . 
there was only in patients with positive to Helicobacter pylori that the administration of 75 mg urea branded causes a significant increase of 13CO2 in the sample , in the first 30 minutes . 
preclinical safety data 
there are no préoccupations relatively to clinical use of the medicinal product .

the spécifications of the spectromètre mass such as the linearity , chemical ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for exactitude system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis was performed with laboratoires qualifiés . 
the precise methodology validée for this use are as follows : 
preparation of the sample for IRMS 
to determine the number of the gas 13C / 12C carbonic of respiration by spectrométrie mass , the gas carbonic should be isolated from the sample breathing and introduit in the spectromètre mass . 
the an automatic preparation for spectromètres mass isotopiques used for the analysis of the test breathing is based on an of séparation by chromatographie to flow continued . 
the water is extracted from the sample using a piège to water Nafion or by the preparation of chromatographie to which sépare each gas in the back of chromatographie to with Hélium as éluant . 
moving into the back , all types of gas respiratory were detected with a détecteur ionique . 
the amount of gas carbonic identified by the time of retention characteristic , is inserted into the spectromètre mass . 
analysis by spectrométrie mass 
for the gas analyser carbonic isolated from the sample , it should be ionisée , molecule by beam , accélérée by a glaucomatous électrique , déviée by a glaucomatous resonance imaging and finalement detected . 
these five steps if effectuent in the analyseur a spectromètre mass , which is represented three parts apart : the source , the tube and the disposal unit . 
the ionisation , the formation of beam and detection are given in the disposal unit . 
introduction the sample 
there is to put the gas carbonic in the analyseur , several systems of introduction . 
for the analysis of the test breathing , équilibrage individual of the gas carbonic the sample with a reference gas standard is essential . 
this gives a exactitude to this system , when the calculation the contents of the gas isotopique carbonic is achieved by compared to a standard independent .

it is recommended that you follow the analysis , as soon as possible after samples collect the syringe-vial-assembly , and in no case after 4 weeks . 
the precise methodology validée for this use are as follows : 
preparation of samples for analysis spectrométrique infrarouge ( NDIR ) 
the rate of 13C / 12C in the carbonic gas samples respiratory is determined directly into the gas breathing expiré . 
the gas breathing within tubes is introduit in the spectromètre NDIR to pump gas . 
the content of water from the sample breathing is maintained about consistent with a piège to water Nafion . 
the pens free of CO2 ( gas ) necessary to the reference étalonnage and to the measurement is produced by a absorbeur of CO2 integrated to analyseur . 
analysis spectrométrique infrarouge 
for the gas analyser carbonic content of the gas breathing , a rayonnement to wide band recommended that a source infrarouge is dirigé all to all into the chamber to measure and to a chamber reference using a hâcheur of beam . 
it is used for détecteurs transmission to double layer with a chamber before and chamber back syringes each one of the gas isotopiquement purs to measure respectively ( 13CO2 and 12CO2 ) . 
in the chamber to measure the rayonnement infrarouge is affaibli by the component gazeux to measure , which perturbe steady state between the beam to measure and the reference beam . 
a fluctuation of room occurs and results in a fluctuation the pressure in the chamber before the détecteur infrarouge . 
a condensateur to membrane relié to this chamber and exposed to a 
a introduction semi-automatique are given by the gas of measure in amounts assessed in the reference gas circulating in the circuit of spectromètre infrarouge . 
this helps to measure the 13C / 12C all concentrations of CO2 above 1 . 
spécifications for dosing proportion 13C / 12C 
the concept of respiratory test is based on the oral dose of urea étiquetée 13C whose is followed by enzymatic hydrolysis , but it also measured by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive the 13CO2 in the gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètres infrarouges for gas respiratory should be able to :

Helicobacter Test INFAI for children agés 3 to 11 years of age may be used for diagnosis in vivo in the infection of the hélicobacter pylori gastroduodenale . 
to evaluate the rate of treatment therapy or when test invasif cannot be drawn or explain the results of the test and not invasif congestion 
this medicinal product is for use diagnosis only . 
posology and method of administration 
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children agés 3 to 11 years of age is test breathing to single administration . 
the dose for patients aged between 3 and 11 years of age is a pot of 45 mg . 
to test , the patient should swallow 100 ml of pur orange juice ( 100 concentrate ) , as meal of child-resistant before the test and tap water ( used to dissolve the 13C-urée ) . 
the patient should be taken on an empty stomach for more than 6 hours , preferably in the night . 
test lasts approximately 40 minutes . 
test should be repeated , it should not be prior to the following day . 
the éradication of Helicobacter pylori could give results positive negative . 
therefore test should only be performed after 4 weeks later , at least , systemic antibacterial therapy and at the end of 2 weeks after the last dose of agents antisécrétoires acids . 
these two medicines may interfere with the presence of Helicobacter pylori . 
it is especially important , after the treatment of éradication of Helicobacter . 
it is important to adhere to properly the instructions for use described in section 6.6 , to which the validité outcome will be uncertain . 
contraindications 
test should not be performed in patients who had or soupçonnés to have an infection gastric or gastritis atrophique which could interfere with the respiratory test to urea . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
test positive alone , it is not an indication of the treatment of éradication . 
a diagnostic différentiel with consider endoscopiques including invasive may be required to for the presence of other conditions such that a ulcer , gastritis autoimmune and malignancies . 
there are insufficient data available on the fiabilité of Helicobacter Test INFAI for children agés 3 to 11 years to recommend use in patients who have had a gastrectomie . 
in cases of gastrite-A particuliers ( gastritis atrophique ) , the respiratory test results may give positive positive , therefore other tests may be required to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori . 
in case of vomiting during the course of the test requiring repeat treatment , it should be considered on an empty stomach prior to the following day , but not is documented in section 4.2 . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children agés 3 to 11 years of age may be affected by all treatments interfering with Helicobacter pylori or the activity of the uréase .

the pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : other diagnostic agents , ATC code : 
no pharmacological activity has been described in the amount of 45 mg of 13C-urée administered by taking during the respiratory test . 
after oral administration , urea branded reached mucosa . 
in the presence of Helicobacter pylori , 13C-urée is metabolised by the uréase of Helicobacter pylori according to the reaction : 
16 2 H2N ( 13CO ) NH2 2 2H2O 
enzyme uréase 
4NH3 2 13CO2 
the carbon dioxide partitions through the blood vessels . 
then it is carried as bicarbonate up in the lung , and excreted in the form of 13CO2 with the air exhalé . 
in the presence of the uréase bacterial , the proportion of carbons isotopes 13C / 12C is affected by how signifiante . 
the amount of 13CO2 in samples respiratory is determined by spectrométrie mass ( IRMS ) and expressed as the absolute differences ( baseline ) at baseline of 00 minute and to 30 minutes . 
the uréase is produced in the stomach only by Helicobacter pylori . 
other bacteria productrices of uréases are rarely present in the flora . 
the site upper to Agenerase tests negative and tests positive to Helicobacter pylori is determined by an 4 , which means that there is an infection when the of is greater than 4 . 
in the absence of uréase bacterial , the amount of a total of urea administered after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract , will be metabolised as urea endogenous . 
ammonia which released , as described above , with the hydrolysis bacterial is incorporated into the metabolism of NH4 . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the 13C-urée administered orally , is metabolised in the carbon dioxide and ammonia or integrated in the cycle endogenous urea . 
any increased 13CO2 should be measured by isotopique analysis . 
the absorption and the distribution of 13CO2 are more rapid that the effect of the uréase . 
thus , the cleavage of the 13 C-urée with uréase of Helicobacter pylori is l Step limitante of full process . 
there was only in patients with positive to Helicobacter pylori that the administration of 45 mg urea branded causes a significant increase of 13CO2 in the sample , in the first 30 minutes . 
preclinical safety data 
there are no préoccupations relatively to clinical use of the medicinal product .

these two medicines may influence the results of Helicobacter Test INFAI . 
this applies , particularly in the treatment of éradication of Helicobacter pylori . 
it is important to adhere to precisely on how to use , which will be questionable validité of the test . 
elements important not supplied with Helicobacter Test INFAI Before tests should be done at , a meal liquid of is ingéré test . 
the meal of test is not supplied with the kit . 
the orange juice pur ( 200 ml ) and a solution of Citric acid ( 1 g diluted in 200 ml ) can be used . 
if a because prescription ( or other contraint ) , you should take any of these tests , please tell your doctor that you proposera an alternative . 
a gobelet and tap water are also required to dissolve the powder of 13C-urée . 
test should be repeated , this can not be done prior to the following day . 
instruction precautions for use for the spectrométrie mass This medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional under medical supervision . 
there you about should be collected in a foil documentation patient enclosed . 
it is recommended that you are fully rest to test . 
the patient should be taken on an empty stomach 6 hours before the use of the test , preferably any night précédante . 
in cases where test either gastric later in the après-midi , it is recommended that you take a mild meal , e. g. of allow and toasts . 
fulfil the second tube sample ( label : time sample : valeur-00-minute ) carrying out of the same way as described in earlier . 
it is not required in patients with analysis spectrométrique infrarouge . 
then , drink immediately before meals with a child-resistant test ( 200 ml of concentrate or orange juice 100 1 g of Citric acid diluted in 200 ml of water ) . 
measure the contained in a glass of water , fulfil the pot a second , and then a third times and aseptically transfer the contents in the glass , in order to achieve approximately 30 ml of solution test . 
the time of administration should be noted . 
the corresponding label code-barre should be placed on the foil documentation patient .

the following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only : 
analysis of the test and spécifications samples for laboratoires 
samples tubes respiratory recueillis in the blood in the glass and plastic 10 ml were analysed by the isotope mass ratio spectrométrie ( IRMS ) . 
the spécifications of the spectromètre mass such as the linearity , chemical ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for exactitude system .

what is Helixate NexGen ? 
Helixate NexGen is supplied as a powder and solvent to mix to make a solution for injection . 
Helixate NexGen contains the active substance octocog alfa ( factor VIII coagulation ) . 
what Helixate NexGen is used for ? 
Helixate NexGen is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a factor VIII deficiency ) . 
Helixate NexGen is intended for the short-term or long-term clinical studies . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how Helixate NexGen is used for ? 
treatment with Helixate NexGen should be prescribed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with haemophilia . 
Helixate NexGen is given by injection into a vein ( intravenously ) for a few minutes , at a rate of 2 ml per minute to . 
the dose and frequency are assessed by that Helixate NexGen is used for the treatment of bleeding ( bleeding ) , or to prevent it during surgery . 
the dose is adjusted depending on the severity of bleeding or the type of surgery . 
Helixate NexGen can also be given by continuous infusion ( drip into a vein ) for at least 7 days in patients undergoing high surgery . 
for a full details on how to determine the doses , please see the Package Leaflet . 
how Helixate NexGen to work ? 
the active substance of Helixate NexGen , octocog alfa is a protein that is a factor blood coagulation . 
in the body , it is one of the active substances ( factors ) involved in the process blood coagulation . 
patients with haemophilia A lack factor VIII , this causes blood coagulation problems , such as bleeding in the joints , muscle or internal organs . 
Helixate NexGen is used to replace the missing factor VIII . 
it corrects the factor VIII deficiency and temporary control bleeding . 
octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology : it is made by a cell that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it human coagulation factor VIII . 
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel . 
Helixate NexGen is similar to the medicinal product KOGENATE , but is prepared differently , so that there is no proteins human in the medicine . 
Helixate NexGen has also been studied as a continuous infusion with 15 patients with haemophilia A undergoing surgery high . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the assessment of the doctor on discontinuation effectif of bleeding . 
what benefit has demonstrated by Helixate NexGen during the studies ? 
in previously treated patients , overall , CI haemorrhage responded to one or two injections of Helixate intraveineuses NexGen . 
in previously untreated patients , approximately 90 of bleeding responded to treatment with one or two injections intraveineuses . 
when Helixate Nexgen was given by continuous infusion , discontinuation of bleeding was evaluated as excellent for the 15 patients . 
what is the risk associated with the use of Helixate NexGen ? 
patients with haemophilia A may develop antibodies factor VIII . 
an antibody is a protein produced by the body in reaction to unknown agents , part of the natural defence system of the body . 
in clinical trials with Helixate Nexgen , this is produced in 14 of patients who had not received any treatment previously and 17 of patients who had previously treatment than 100 days . 
if the antibodies develop , Helixate Nexgen not working effectively . 
hypersensitivity ( allergic reactions sometimes ) has been observed in patients treated with medicinal products containing a factor VIII . 
Helixate NexGen should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to factor VIII coagulation or hamster or to any of the other ingredients .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII ) . 
this preparation does not contain factor Willebrand and therefore should not be used in the treatment of the disease of Willebrand . 
posology and method of administration 
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with haemophilia . 
dosage The number of units factor VIII was given in International Units ( IU ) compared to standard current of WHO for signs of factors VIII . 
the factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either in the percentage ( relative to human plasma normal ) , or in International Units ( relative to a standard International for factor VIII ) . 
a International Unit ( IU ) of factor VIII corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma . 
2 The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the outcome empirical as 1 International Unit ( IU ) of factor VIII per kg body weight increases the activity of factor VIII 1.5 to 2.5 . 
the required dose determined using the following formulas : 
I. 
nb of IU = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( of normal ) x 0.5 
increased expected factor VIII ( of normal ) = 2 x nb of IU given body weight ( kg ) 
the doses and duration of replacement therapy should be adjusted according to the patient &apos;s needs ( weight , and severity of disorders of haemostasis , injection site and the rate of bleeding , titre in possible inhibitor and factor VIII ) . 
the table below gives to act solely as a guideline values minimal in plasma levels of factor VIII to obtain .

the dose and frequency of administration should always be oriented with each individual cases based on clinical efficacy noted . 
in some circumstances , doses higher than calculated may be necessary , especially during the first administration . 
during treatment , as appropriate levels is recommended in order to assess the dose to be administered and the frequency at which repeat infusions . 
in the case of major surgery , a strict précis of replacement therapy by an analysis of blood clotting ( activity plasma factor VIII ) is indispensable . 
the response of the patients at individual factor VIII may vary , leading to a level of in vivo recovery and different half-life . 
4 In clinical study in adult patients with haemophilia , who have had major surgery has shown that Helixate NexGen can be used as a continuous infusion surgery ( in the pre- , per- and postoperative ) . 
in this study , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlébites infusion site as with any intravenous infusion . 
Helixate NexGen contains a low levels of polysorbate- 80 , excipient known to increase the rate of tooth of di- ( 2-ethylhexyl do not freeze ) from materials polyvinylchloride ( PVC ) . 
this is should be taken into account when administered as a continuous infusion . 
for the treatment prophylactic of bleeding in patients with severe , doses ranging from 20 to 60 IU of Helixate NexGen per kg body weight , should be given every 2 to 3 days . 
in some cases , especially in the younger patients , most often between the dose or higher doses may be necessary . 
the data were obtained in 61 children aged less than 6 years of age . 
cases of patients with inhibitors 
patients should be monitored for the development of inhibitor of factor VIII . 
if the levels of factor VIII was not reached , or if bleeding are not controlled with the appropriate doses , the presence of a factor VIII should be evaluated for using the those laboratory tests . 
if a is present to a titre less than 10 Bethesda Units ( BU ) ( BU ) per ml , the administration of a dose additional factor VIII technology may neutraliser the and allow to continue to obtain a clinical response to treatment with Helixate NexGen . 
however , in the presence of a doses necessary are variable and should be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical response and the plasma activity factor VIII . 
in patients whose titre of the exceeds 10 BU or who have a higher anamnestique response , the use of a concentrate of complex prothrombique activated or by a factor VII activated technology ( rFVIIa ) should be considered . 
such drugs should be conduits by physicians experienced in the normal to treat patients with haemophilia A. 
method of administration Dissoudre preparation as described in section 6.6 . 
Helixate NexGen should be administered intravenously over several minutes . 
the rate of administration should be determined by the by the patient &apos;s rate of dose ( maximum : 
Helixate NexGen can be given by continuous infusion . 
the infusion rate should be calculated from the clearance and factor VIII to . 
example : for a patient 75 kg clearance is 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate may be of 3 IU / h / kg to obtain a FVIII 100 . 
for calculate in ml / h should multiply the infusion rate in IU / h / kg , with the &#91; kg body weight / concentration of the solution ( IU / ml ) .

infusion of vitesses higher may be warranted in situations where clearance accélérée in haemorrhage information or étendues tissue during surgery . 
the infusion vitesses further should be calculated from the actual levels factor VIII achieved during each days after the operation , using the following equation : 
contraindications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or hamster or to any of the excipients . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
as with any medicinal product any intravenous protein , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible . 
patients should be informed that the onset of chest tightness , dizziness , hypotension , slight and nausea during the infusion may be the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis . 
symptomatic treatment and the treatment of hypersensitivity should be instaurés . 
in case of allergic or anaphylactic reactions the injection or infusion immediately , and patients must be advised to contact their physician . 
in case of shock , the current medical standards for shock should be initiated . 
antibody formation neutralisant ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. 
these inhibitors are always immunoglobulin G directed against the activity pro-coagulante factor VIII and are quantifiés in Bethesda Units ( BU ) modified ( BU ) per ml in plasma . 
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated between other , exposure to factor VIII and genetic ; this risk is the higher within 20 days of exposure to antigen . 
more rarely , inhibitors may occur after the first 100 exposure days . 
cases of recurrent inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after change by a factor VIII technology with another in patients treated with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitors . 
patients treated with recombinant factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically , and with laboratory tests appropriate , for the development of inhibitors . 
see also section 4.8 Effects Indésirables . 
in a clinical study involving on the use of continuous infusion surgery , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlebitis infusion site as with any intravenous infusion . 
in the interest of patients , it is recommended , lorque this is possible that of Helixate NexGen , the name and batch number of the medicinal product is enregistré . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial , i. e. essentially sodium free . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no interaction of Helixate NexGen with other medicinal products is not known . 
pregnancy and lactation 
Helixate NexGen has not been studied in reproductive studies in animals . 
in view of the rarity of haemophilia , in women , there are no data on the use of Helixate NexGen in pregnant women or during breast-feeding . 
therefore , Helixate NexGen should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding as if the indication is incontestable . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Helixate NexGen has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines . 
undesirable effects 
after administration of Helixate NexGen , there was a few rare cases of the side effects minor to moderate as presented in the table below :

antibody formation neutralisant factor VIII ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. 
during the studies performed with factor VIII technology , development of inhibitors were mainly seen in patients not previously treated patients . 
therefore , it should be monitored closely patients , clinically and with laboratory tests appropriate , for the development of inhibitors . 
in clinical studies , Helixate NexGen was used in the treatment of bleeding in 37 receiving ( PUPs ) and 23 of patients treated with minima ( MTPs , defined as up to 4 days of exposure ) . 
five of 37 PUPs ( 14 ) and 4 of 23 MTPs ( 17 ) receiving Helixate NexGen developed inhibitors :

3 to 18 days ) . 
the number of days mean exposure in clinical trials was 114 ( extreme case 4-478 ) . 
four on five patients who had not with 20 days of exposure at the end of study were finalement passed the 20 days of exposure during the follow-up after the study , and any of these developed was low-titre inhibitor . 
the one patient was lose of sight . 
7 In clinical studies involving 73 patients treated with an , defined as &gt; 100 exposure days ) and monitored for 4 years , no inhibitor transplantation has not been observed . 
in studies post-AMM to large Functional involving Helixate NexGen , which included over 1000 patients , have been reported : less than 0.2 of PTPs developed inhibitors transplantation . 
in a sous-population defined as less than 20 days at baseline of the study , less than 11 have developed inbiteurs transplantation . 
during the studies , no patient developed clinically significant levels of antibodies against of mouse or hamster protein found in trace amounts in the preparation . 
however , the possibility of allergic reaction to constituents , such as trace of mouse and hamster in the preparation , in some patients are prédisposés ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) . 
overdose 
no signs of overdose with factor VIII technology clotting have been reported . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : factor VIII of blood clotting , ATC code B02BD02 
factor VIII and factor Willebrand ( FvW ) are complex two molecules for physiologiques different . 
have an infusion in a patient haemophilia , factor VIII binds to FvW in the blood circulation . 
it acts as a cofactor factor IX , accelerating the conversion of factor X factor X activated . 
factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin . 
patients with haemophilia , is an inherited condition of the clotting gender due to a lack of levels factor VIII : 
C that causes multiple bleeding in the joints , muscle or internal organs , spontaneously , following a accident or trauma surgical . 
by therapy replacement therapy in FVIII plasma levels are increased , a temporary is factor déficitaire and tendency bleeding . 
the partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) is a mean classique is biological activity of factor VIII in vitro . 
it is allongé in all patients . 
the rate and the time of APTT observed after administration of Helixate NexGen are similar to from with factor VIII species . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
analysis of the in vivo recovery in previously treated patients was shown to Helixate NexGen a mean increase factor VIII 2 by IU / kg body weight . 
this finding is similar to reported for factor VIII Use in plasma . 
after administration of Helixate NexGen , décroissance peak of factor VIII activity is type exponentiel biphasic , with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 15 hours . 
this is similar to that of factor VIII that the mean terminal half-life is approximately 13 hours . 
preclinical safety data 
even at doses more times higher than the recommended clinical dose ( based on the basis of the body ) , the Helixate NexGen have been no acute toxic or subaigu in laboratory animals ( mouse , rat and rabbit dog ) . 
due to the immune response that suscitent proteins Strains in all species mammalian , specific studies of repeated dosing ( based on studies in reproduction toxicity , so carcinogenic potential ) have not been performed with octocog alfa . 
no studies of mutagenic potential of Helixate NexGen have not been performed as no mutagenic potential had not been décelé in vitro or in vivo with the product prédécesseur of Helixate NexGen .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII ) . 
this preparation does not contain factor Willebrand and therefore should not be used in the treatment of the disease of Willebrand . 
posology and method of administration 
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with haemophilia . 
dosage The number of units factor VIII was given in International Units ( IU ) compared to standard current of WHO for signs of factors VIII . 
the factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either in the percentage ( relative to human plasma normal ) , or in International Units ( relative to a standard International for factor VIII ) . 
a International Unit ( IU ) of factor VIII corresponds to the amount of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma . 
20 The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the outcome empirical as 1 International Unit ( IU ) of factor VIII per kg body weight increases the activity of factor VIII 1.5 to 2.5 . 
the required dose determined using the following formulas : 
I. 
nb of IU = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( of normal ) x 0.5 
increased expected factor VIII ( of normal ) = 2 x nb of IU given body weight ( kg ) 
the doses and duration of replacement therapy should be adjusted according to the patient &apos;s needs ( weight , and severity of disorders of haemostasis , injection site and the rate of bleeding , titre in possible inhibitor and factor VIII ) . 
the table below gives to act solely as a guideline values minimal in plasma levels of factor VIII to obtain .

the dose and frequency of administration should always be oriented with each individual cases based on clinical efficacy noted . 
in some circumstances , doses higher than calculated may be necessary , especially during the first administration . 
during treatment , as appropriate levels is recommended in order to assess the dose to be administered and the frequency at which repeat infusions . 
in the case of major surgery , a strict précis of replacement therapy by an analysis of blood clotting ( activity plasma factor VIII ) is indispensable . 
the response of the patients at individual factor VIII may vary , leading to a level of in vivo recovery and different half-life . 
22 A clinical study in adult patients with haemophilia , who have had major surgery has shown that Helixate NexGen can be used as a continuous infusion surgery ( in the pre- , per- and postoperative ) . 
in this study , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlébites infusion site as with any intravenous infusion . 
Helixate NexGen contains a low levels of polysorbate- 80 , excipient known to increase the rate of tooth of di- ( 2-ethylhexyl do not freeze ) from materials polyvinylchloride ( PVC ) . 
this is should be taken into account when administered as a continuous infusion . 
for the treatment prophylactic of bleeding in patients with severe , doses ranging from 20 to 60 IU of Helixate NexGen per kg body weight , should be given every 2 to 3 days . 
in some cases , especially in the younger patients , most often between the dose or higher doses may be necessary . 
the data were obtained in 61 children aged less than 6 years of age . 
cases of patients with inhibitors 
patients should be monitored for the development of inhibitor of factor VIII . 
if the levels of factor VIII was not reached , or if bleeding are not controlled with the appropriate doses , the presence of a factor VIII should be evaluated for using the those laboratory tests . 
if a is present to a titre less than 10 Bethesda Units ( BU ) ( BU ) per ml , the administration of a dose additional factor VIII technology may neutraliser the and allow to continue to obtain a clinical response to treatment with Helixate NexGen . 
however , in the presence of a doses necessary are variable and should be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical response and the plasma activity factor VIII . 
in patients whose titre of the exceeds 10 BU or who have a higher anamnestique response , the use of a concentrate of complex prothrombique activated or by a factor VII activated technology ( rFVIIa ) should be considered . 
such drugs should be conduits by physicians experienced in the normal to treat patients with haemophilia A. 
method of administration Dissoudre preparation as described in section 6.6 . 
Helixate NexGen should be administered intravenously over several minutes . 
the rate of administration should be determined by the by the patient &apos;s rate of dose ( maximum : 
Helixate NexGen can be given by continuous infusion . 
the infusion rate should be calculated from the clearance and factor VIII to . 
example : for a patient 75 kg clearance is 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate may be of 3 IU / h / kg to obtain a FVIII 100 . 
for calculate in ml / h should multiply the infusion rate in IU / h / kg , with the &#91; kg body weight / concentration of the solution ( IU / ml ) .

infusion of vitesses higher may be warranted in situations where clearance accélérée in haemorrhage information or étendues tissue during surgery . 
the infusion vitesses further should be calculated from the actual levels factor VIII achieved during each days after the operation , using the following equation : 
contraindications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or hamster or to any of the excipients . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
as with any medicinal product any intravenous protein , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible . 
patients should be informed that the onset of chest tightness , dizziness , hypotension , slight and nausea during the infusion may be the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis . 
symptomatic treatment and the treatment of hypersensitivity should be instaurés . 
in case of allergic or anaphylactic reactions the injection or infusion immediately , and patients must be advised to contact their physician . 
in case of shock , the current medical standards for shock should be initiated . 
antibody formation neutralisant ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. 
these inhibitors are always immunoglobulin G directed against the activity pro-coagulante factor VIII and are quantifiés in Bethesda Units ( BU ) modified ( BU ) per ml in plasma . 
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated between other , exposure to factor VIII and genetic ; this risk is the higher within 20 days of exposure to antigen . 
more rarely , inhibitors may occur after the first 100 exposure days . 
cases of recurrent inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after change by a factor VIII technology with another in patients treated with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitors . 
patients treated with recombinant factor VIII should be carefully monitored clinically , and with laboratory tests appropriate , for the development of inhibitors . 
see also section 4.8 Effects Indésirables . 
in a clinical study involving on the use of continuous infusion surgery , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlebitis infusion site as with any intravenous infusion . 
in the interest of patients , it is recommended , lorque this is possible that of Helixate NexGen , the name and batch number of the medicinal product is enregistré . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial , i. e. essentially sodium free . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no interaction of Helixate NexGen with other medicinal products is not known . 
pregnancy and lactation 
Helixate NexGen has not been studied in reproductive studies in animals . 
in view of the rarity of haemophilia , in women , there are no data on the use of Helixate NexGen in pregnant women or during breast-feeding . 
therefore , Helixate NexGen should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding as if the indication is incontestable . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Helixate NexGen has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines . 
undesirable effects 
after administration of Helixate NexGen , there was a few rare cases of the side effects minor to moderate as presented in the table below :

antibody formation neutralisant factor VIII ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. 
during the studies performed with factor VIII technology , development of inhibitors were mainly seen in patients not previously treated patients . 
therefore , it should be monitored closely patients , clinically and with laboratory tests appropriate , for the development of inhibitors . 
in clinical studies , Helixate NexGen was used in the treatment of bleeding in 37 receiving ( PUPs ) and 23 of patients treated with minima ( MTPs , defined as up to 4 days of exposure ) . 
five of 37 PUPs ( 14 ) and 4 of 23 MTPs ( 17 ) receiving Helixate NexGen developed inhibitors :

the number of days mean exposure in clinical trials was 114 ( extreme case 4-478 ) . 
four on five patients who had not with 20 days of exposure at the end of study were finalement passed the 20 days of exposure during the follow-up after the study , and any of these developed was low-titre inhibitor . 
the one patient was lose of sight . 
25 In clinical studies involving 73 patients treated with an , defined as &gt; 100 exposure days ) and monitored for 4 years , no inhibitor transplantation has not been observed . 
in studies post-AMM to large Functional involving Helixate NexGen , which included over 1000 patients , have been reported : less than 0.2 of PTPs developed inhibitors transplantation . 
in a sous-population defined as less than 20 days at baseline of the study , less than 11 have developed inbiteurs transplantation . 
during the studies , no patient developed clinically significant levels of antibodies against of mouse or hamster protein found in trace amounts in the preparation . 
however , the possibility of allergic reaction to constituents , such as trace of mouse and hamster in the preparation , in some patients are prédisposés ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) . 
overdose 
no signs of overdose with factor VIII technology clotting have been reported .

during the studies , no patient developed clinically significant levels of antibodies against of mouse or hamster protein found in trace amounts in the preparation . 
however , the possibility of allergic reaction to constituents , such as trace of mouse and hamster in the preparation , in some patients are prédisposés ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) . 
overdose 
no signs of overdose with factor VIII technology clotting have been reported . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : factor VIII of blood clotting , ATC code B02BD02 
factor VIII and factor Willebrand ( FvW ) are complex two molecules for physiologiques different . 
have an infusion in a patient haemophilia , factor VIII binds to FvW in the blood circulation . 
it acts as a cofactor factor IX , accelerating the conversion of factor X factor X activated . 
factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin . 
patients with haemophilia , is an inherited condition of the clotting gender due to a lack of levels factor VIII : 
C that causes multiple bleeding in the joints , muscle or internal organs , spontaneously , following a accident or trauma surgical . 
by therapy replacement therapy in FVIII plasma levels are increased , a temporary is factor déficitaire and tendency bleeding . 
the partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) is a mean classique is biological activity of factor VIII in vitro . 
it is allongé in all patients . 
the rate and the time of APTT observed after administration of Helixate NexGen are similar to from with factor VIII species . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
analysis of the in vivo recovery in previously treated patients was shown to Helixate NexGen a mean increase factor VIII 2 by IU / kg body weight . 
this finding is similar to reported for factor VIII Use in plasma . 
after administration of Helixate NexGen , décroissance peak of factor VIII activity is type exponentiel biphasic , with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 15 hours . 
this is similar to that of factor VIII that the mean terminal half-life is approximately 13 hours . 
preclinical safety data 
even at doses more times higher than the recommended clinical dose ( based on the basis of the body ) , the Helixate NexGen have been no acute toxic or subaigu in laboratory animals ( mouse , rat and rabbit dog ) . 
due to the immune response that suscitent proteins Strains in all species mammalian , specific studies of repeated dosing ( based on studies in reproduction toxicity , so carcinogenic potential ) have not been performed with octocog alfa . 
no studies of mutagenic potential of Helixate NexGen have not been performed as no mutagenic potential had not been décelé in vitro or in vivo with the product prédécesseur of Helixate NexGen .
