hypersensitivity to the active substance , to arachides or soya or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average dose 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
however , the clinical experience of 
49 the olanzapine is limited in patients with disease associated with , caution is recommended when the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
50 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take the tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
51 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
55 significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
56 There is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
57 In patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
58 in healthy elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
59 In studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , disease 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
64 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
65 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take the tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
66 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
70 significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
72 In patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
73 in healthy elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
74 In studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
mutagenicity 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average dose 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
however , the clinical experience of 
79 the olanzapine is limited in patients with disease associated with , caution is recommended when the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
80 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take the tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
81 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , it is not reached at the day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine .

interstitial , an increase in the body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
in clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , more frequent , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
85 Last within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 nervous system disorders Very common : 
sedation ( including hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) Gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
88 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
89 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine can be 
2 administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or the concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
4 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , schizophrenia patients with a lot of risk factors for VTE , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
5 blurred vision have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
6 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
10 Children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite .

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In the event of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
14 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or the concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
20 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , schizophrenia patients with a lot of risk factors for VTE , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
21 blurred vision have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
22 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
26 Children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In the event of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
30 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or the concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
36 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , schizophrenia patients with a lot of risk factors for VTE , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
37 blurred vision have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
38 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
42 Children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In the event of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
46 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients .

special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
51 Post-marketing vascular brain adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
52 Normal liver ) and asymptomatic transient elevations in transaminases ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , schizophrenia patients with a lot of risk factors for VTE , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
53 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
54 potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

information on special populations In clinical trials in patients aged déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with a higher incidence of death and vascular events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were adverse events of very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
58 a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite .

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In the event of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
59 treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
61 The olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 62 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or the concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
67 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , schizophrenia patients with a lot of risk factors for VTE , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
68 blurred vision have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Patients OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
69 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , it is not reached at the day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and blood pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced changes , clinically significant weight ( increased ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in patients aged déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with a higher incidence of death and vascular events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were adverse events of very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
73 Children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 disorders systeme disorders Very common : 
sedation ( including hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) Gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In the event of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
77 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
carcinogenicity Based on the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
12 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
13 combination of lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
14 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
15 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness clinical improvement in the long term . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
18 Children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
19 Post-marketing vascular brain adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipidiquesDes lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
20 symptoms suggesting of liver injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
21 postural hypotension A orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , it is not reached at the day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
26 8 Post-marketing evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and blood pressure mammaire ) have been rare .

a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were adverse events of very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been commonly rapportésLors of the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
27 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 nervous system disorders Very common : 
sedation ( including hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) Gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
28 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
29 combination of lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
30 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
31 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness clinical improvement in the long term . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
35 Post-marketing vascular brain adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergiqueBien activity than the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
36 with elevations of ALT or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of liver injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
37 postural hypotension A orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , it is not reached at the day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine .

information on special populations In clinical trials in patients aged déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with a higher incidence of death and vascular events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
44 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
45 combination of lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
46 For women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
47 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness clinical improvement in the long term . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
51 Post-marketing vascular brain adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel with autraitement antipsychotics . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
52 with elevations of ALT or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of liver injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
53 postural hypotension A orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interactions is not recommended as this could be expected 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .

in clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , more frequent , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
60 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
in a study in patients receiving lithium or valproate for at least two weeks , the introduction of 10 mg of olanzapine ( in 
61 combination of lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
62 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
63 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
67 Post-marketing vascular brain adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
68 with elevations of ALT or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of liver injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
69 postural hypotension A orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interactions is not recommended as this could be expected 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
76 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
77 combination of lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
78 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
79 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
83 Post-marketing vascular brain adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
84 with elevations of ALT or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of liver injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension 85 A orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interactions is not recommended as this could be expected 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , it is not reached at the day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and blood pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
90 Use hard capsules ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced changes , clinically significant weight ( increased ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in patients aged déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with a higher incidence of death and vascular events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were adverse events of very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
interstitial , an increase in the body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
in clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , more frequent , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
91 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite .

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
92 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 to 12 weeks . 
patients should be used in combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
94 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
CI prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients .

( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
lipid disorders Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
101 emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity on the centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , orodispersible tablet , contains tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) , which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
102 clinical data are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
103 in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , it is not reached at the day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
106 8 Post-marketing evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and blood pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced changes , clinically significant weight ( increased ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in patients aged déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with a higher incidence of death and vascular events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were adverse events of very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
interstitial , an increase in the body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
in clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , more frequent , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
108 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the tablet orodispersible olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
110 in healthy elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
the tablet orodispersible Olanzapine Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the oral solution is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , milk , juice pomme or chew ) immediately before administration . 
the tablet orodispersible olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dose and frequency of administration of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors ruvrique warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
116 Changes lipid Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
117 activity in the general centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
in studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies related to the treatment was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
118 The mean AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , it is not reached at the day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and blood pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
122 Use hard capsules ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced changes , clinically significant weight ( increased ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in patients aged déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with a higher incidence of death and vascular events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were adverse events of very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
interstitial , an increase in the body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
in clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , more frequent , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
124 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the tablet orodispersible olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
treatment in healthy elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
130 The orodispersible tablet Olanzapine Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the oral solution is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , milk , juice pomme or chew ) immediately before administration . 
the tablet orodispersible olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dose and frequency of administration of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors ruvrique warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
132 Changes lipid Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
133 activity in the general centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies related to the treatment was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
yellow orangé S ( E110 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , oral solution contains the yellow orangé S ( E110 ) which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
134 Inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase in AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of somnolence , dizziness , patients should be warned on the risk associated with the use of machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of all side effects are presented in the table below has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock and assistance circulation 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or any other bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine was also found in the efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the tablet orodispersible olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
142 in healthy elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , have ever had responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , treatment should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression of the treatment of the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has not to incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering during the withdrawal of the olanzapine . 
the tablet orodispersible Olanzapine Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the oral solution is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , milk , juice pomme or chew ) immediately before administration . 
the tablet orodispersible olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dose and frequency of administration of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents compared to studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and should be used with caution . 
gender The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for women compared to humans . 
smoking The starting dose and the dose range do not require dose adjustment for patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance of more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase the dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was superior in the olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events of vascular brain ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater vascular brain adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event brain vascular had pre-existing risk factors . 
a greater than 75 years of age and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine . 
the efficacy of the olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Influenza-like Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) has also been there as olanzapine . 
clinical signs of NMS 36 , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , sweating increased , and general heart rate ) . 
signs may include such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient shows signs or symptoms indicative of NMS , hyperthermia unexplained or with other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and There rare cases , hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant has been reported . 
an appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
two Changes lipid Post-marketing lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients who have problems with lipid and in patients with risk factors that may favoriser the development of lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of events related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic aminotransferase ( ALT and AST have been commonly reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT or AST during treatment should be done under strict and may require a dosage reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) during the withdrawal of treatment with olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- emboliques factor ) , any of the potential risk of thromboembolic injury vein ( such as the immobilisation capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
149 activity in the general centrally acting Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
because of the activity of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , there are or a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
headache Dyskinesia studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies related to the treatment was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however , the risk of tardive Dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered as early as signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , products stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
only a mild to moderate increases in the clearance of the olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase in Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
150 The mean AUC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 like e. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products The olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes of in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate was not genotoxic in the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with advanced disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the mean exposure neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed .

interstitial , an increase in the body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
in clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , more frequent , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania of bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be of plasma levels high valproate . 
a greater than 10 of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite or weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents The olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents adults has been given , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a higher in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients . 
a clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the extent of body weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . 
155 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
nervous system disorders Very common : 
sedation ( including hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) Gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
reduction of the total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , the prolactinémie 12 . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in the levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypotension , hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 of the event of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in experience at a dose as low as 450 mg , but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote for the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted depending on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
- 156 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC code N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission to neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) , while the observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the case of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken significantly more weight compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels , and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term use are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the tablet orodispersible olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on the age or gender . 
158 in healthy elderly ( age 65 years and over ) , compared to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is hard capsules ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in schizophrenia 44 patients age 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( N = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of the test mass have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine radioactive was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
for patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is in the elderly than in young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetic parameters of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to the olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and the number less important smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristic neuroleptics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs have been reported : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , anticholinergiques and peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression the CNS . 
parameters growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of ovaries and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including dose-dépendantes reductions in the number of circulating WBC in mice and decreases in white blood cells in specific circulating rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have not shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or prolifératives of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées in rats treated with the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in the levels of the offspring were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation assays in bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo tests on mammalian cell culture . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that olanzapine was not carcinogenic potential .

it is available as a powder and solvent to mix to obtain a solution for injection ( 1.3 or 5 mg / ml ) , or ready to use in a cartridge ( headache General disorders or 6.7 mg / ml ) . 
Omnitrope is a biosimilar &apos;medicine : alternatively as , Omnitrope is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also known as the reference medicine ) . 
the reference medicine for Omnitrope is Genotropin . 
for more information on biosimilar medicines , see the document rassemblant questions and answers here . 
what Omnitrope is used for ? 
diagnosis should be confirmed by a genetic test appropriate . 
Omnitrope is also used in adult patients with a deficiency administration in growth hormone , as replacement therapy . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how Omnitrope is used for ? 
treatment with Omnitrope should be followed by a doctor who has experience in the management of patients who have problems with blood . 
Omnitrope is given by injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) once a day , at bedtime . 
the patient or the soignant may inject top Omnitrope , after receiving formation not father a doctor or a ( e ) nurse . 
cartridges Omnitrope should be used only by an injection site specifically designed to this medicine .

7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel . 
how Omnitrope to work ? 
the active substance of Omnitrope , somatropine , is identical to the growth hormone human . 
it is produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology : the hormone is made by a bacterium that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce filgrastim the . 
Omnitrope replaces the natural hormone . 
how has Omnitrope been studied ? 
Omnitrope was studied to show that it is comparable to the reference medicine , Genotropin . 
Omnitrope was compared with Genotropin in 89 children with a deficiency , growth hormone and have not received treatment . 
the studies lasted nine months ; measures height , at the start and at the end of the study , and the rate of growth , during the study , have been performed . 
to study the safety of Omnitrope , this medicinal product has been administered to 51 other children over one year in older . 
what is the benefit with Omnitrope shown during the studies ? 
after nine months , the Omnitrope and Genotropin to increases were similar in size and growth rate ( equivalent to an increase in 10.7 cm per year with both medicinal products ) . 
therefore , it has been shown to Omnitrope is as effective as Genotropin . 
what is the risk associated with the use of Omnitrope ? 
the side effects reported with Omnitrope were type and severity similar to those observed with the reference medicine , Genotropin . 
in addition , as with all of protein , some patients may develop antibodies ( proteins produced in response to Omnitrope ) . 
however , these antibodies have no effect on the inhibitor . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with the use of Omnitrope , see the Package Leaflet . 
Omnitrope should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to the somatropine or to any of the other ingredients ( the ready to use and the solvent of Omnitrope 5 mg / ml contain benzyl alcohol ) . 
Omnitrope should not be used when the patient experiences a tumour active an illness or acute life-threatening . 
for a full list of restrictions , see the Package Leaflet . 
the somatropine can interfere with the use of the body . 
the level of sugar in the blood should be monitored during treatment and it can also be necessary to adjust the therapy with insulin or in be initiated . 
why has Omnitrope been approved ? 
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided , according to the EU requirements , as Omnitrope has a profile of quality , safety and efficacy comparable to that of Genotropin . 
the CHMP is therefore of the opinion that , as for Genotropin , the benefit of this medicine is the risk that it produces . 
which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Omnitrope ? 
the measures taken to ensure the safe use of Omnitrope are related to grounds use the medicine .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
infants , children and adolescents 
- Retard growth consistent with a deficiency somatotrope 
- Retard growth related to a syndrome of Turner 
- Retard growth associated with chronic renal failure . 
- Retard growth ( height current &lt; -2,5 SDS ( score standard déviation ) and size parentale 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by genetic test appropriate . 
adults 
- Treatment replacement therapy in adults with severe somatotrope deficiency . 
patients 
with a severe somatotrope acquis in adulthood are defined as a condition known hypothalamo-hypophysaire and at least one other hormone deficiency adenoma , except that of the prolactine . 
a single dynamic test should be performed to diagnostiquer or exclude a deficiency , growth hormone in these patients . 
the limits of tests dynamiques should only be swallowed defined . 
posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
posology and method of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were observed . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
children with the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year , including épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
growth retardation in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure patients : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses can be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 ) .

deficiency , growth hormone in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually over the needs of the patient , determined by the levels of IGF-1 yielding concentrations of IGF-1 , on the basis of age not above the upper 2 ) . 
patients with a IGF-1 is of normal at the beginning of treatment should be given the growth hormone up to a level of IGF-1 higher in the range of the normal range , not to exceed 2 ) . 
the clinical response of the side effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increase of the sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen , are sous-dosées while males are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the hormone somatotrope should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
3 The injection should be subcutaneous and the injection site should vary to avoid the onset of lipoatrophies . 
instructions for use and handling , see section 6.6 . 
Contre-indications 
- Hypersensitivity to the somatropine or to any of the excipients . 
- The somatropine should not be used in the event of tumour and any treatment activity . 
antitumour should be completed before starting treatment . 
- The somatropine should not be used to support the growth of patients whose 
- patients with a critique acute have complications being secondary to an 
surgery to sick opened abdominal surgery , a polytraumatisme , an acute respiratory failure , or situation similar should not be treated with the growth hormone . 
for patients receiving replacement therapy , refer to section 4.4 . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine may induce a resistance and in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 by T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and an increase in the serum concentration in T3 . 
in general , the peripheral levels of thyroid hormones remain within the reference normes healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on the rate of thyroid hormones may to have clinical consequences for patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique middle in which a anticipating metabolic hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is especially advised control thyroid function by initiation of therapy with the somatropine and following dose adjustment . 
a decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this reduction may be related to changes transport proteins or to an increase in hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of deficiency somatotrope secondary to treatment together , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with predisposing conditions endocriniennes , including those relatifs to a deficiency , growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse of the hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe headache , or , visual , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of oeil for a possible swelling papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if there is occurs , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
4 recommend the course of continued therapy , the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
however , the clinical experience showed that the réintroduction treatment was often possible without récurrence intracranial of hypertension . 
if treatment with the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the onset of symptoms hypertension intracranial is required . 
in patients aged over 60 years of age , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be combined with energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with a syndrome of Prader- Willi , for signs of airway obstruction , the sleep apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of airway obstruction , the problem will be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea of subjective should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with consider reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie night , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of airway obstruction ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if apnoea of subjective is suspected . 
all patients had a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infection , which should be diagnosed as early as possible and effectively . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should also be done under control pondéral prior to and during treatment with growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop in a rapid growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of scoliose during treatment with growth hormone . 
the experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before starting treatment , then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , test hyperglycaemia been orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical event , growth hormone should not be given . 
5 In children / adolescents are small to age gestational , it is recommended to measure the levels of IGF-l prior to initiating therapy , and subsequently 2 times a year . 
if on measures , the levels of IGF-l are greater than 2 SD compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
the experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately before puberty in paediatric patients are small to age gestational is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy immediately before puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final solution is reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal prior to initiating therapy . 
to be confirmed delayed , the growth advises should be followed to for one year before emergency treatment . 
during this period , the treatment of renal insufficiency ( including control of the acidosis hyperparathyroidism , and the condition nutritionnel ) should have been observed and should be held throughout the course of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued in the event of kidney transplantation . 
it is not known , to date , data available on the height permanent of patients with chronic renal failure patients treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
due to the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients with a critique acute benefits of continuing treatment in this situation should be provided therapy with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a critique acute other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine should be provided therapy with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of an interaction study performed in adult patients with a deficiency , growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : thyroid sex steroids , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and in section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there is no clinical experience of therapy in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animal studies on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in the event of pregnancy . 
when a pregnancy normal , the levels of growth hormone adenoma decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the hormone 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary for deficiency growth hormone in women for the 3e trimester of pregnancy . 
it is not known that the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal intestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
particular attention should be paid when Omnitrope is administered to women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
undesirable effects 
a reduction of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is started , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as stiffness oedema , peripheral coldness , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these side effects are very severe to moderate , they occur within the first month of treatment and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and the age of patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in paediatric patients , these side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leukaemias have been reported in paediatric patients atteintsd&apos; deficiency growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency is similar to those in children with no deficiency growth hormone . 
immune system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine caused formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low , and their formation there is evidence of no clinical evidence . 
Endocrine disorders 
type 2 diabetes . 
nervous system disorders 
common : 
Uncommon : 
paraesthesia in the adulte. of nasolacrimal carpien syndrome in adults ; paraesthesia in the patient pédiatrique. intracranial bénigne hypertension .

7 General disorders and administration site conditions 
common : 
skin reactions localised and passagères at the site of injection for paediatric patients . 
Uncommon : 
oedema peripheral in paediatric patients . 
overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the initial acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia , and then secondary to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , long term lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of the excess growth hormone in humans . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : thyroid of antéhypophyse and analogues . 
ATC code : 
the somatropine is a potent metabolic hormone signals important in the metabolism of lipid , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal by increasing the retention azotée in stimulating the growth of skeletal muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases lipolysis and decreases baseline levels within adequate lipid of the body . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentration of IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties were observed . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of liver receptors , causing increases in LDL-cholesterol levels , and change the lipid profile and lipoprotéines serum levels . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone results in a decrease in LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum levels . 
a decrease in total cholesterol serum can also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
paediatric patients with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated with the administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the deficiency , growth hormone is associated with a decrease in plasma and volumes extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine results in a sodium retention , potassium and phosphorique . 
metabolism bone : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density in the body increase sites of long term administration of somatropine to patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
exercise capacity : 
the strength muscle and the patient &apos;s ability to exercise are améliorées following long term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also the heart rate , but the mechanism has has 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , strengths of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used for up to a final . 
data from the published literature suggest an late 0.5 SD in children / adolescents small to age gestational are not receiving and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety information is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
elimination The mean terminal a half life of the somatropine is approximately 0.4 hours after administration of intra- venous adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope powder and solvent for solution for injection , the half-life is reached 3 hours . 
sous-population The absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in patients male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients in the differential races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to this . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans subaiguë toxicity studies and local tolerance with Omnitrope revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other studies of general toxicity and local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the studies of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo mutation genetic technology and induction aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
there have been observed in a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients following long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the medicinal product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of these findings is not clear . 
in another study , there was no gullet chromosomal differences in the risk of patients who had been treated with the somatropine long-term use .

Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
paediatric patients with the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year , including épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
growth retardation in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure patients : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses can be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .

treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually over the needs of the patient , determined by the levels of IGF-1 yielding concentrations of IGF-1 , on the basis of age not above the upper 2 ) . 
patients with a IGF-1 is of normal at the beginning of treatment should be given the growth hormone up to a level of IGF-1 higher in the range of the normal range , not to exceed 2 ) . 
the clinical response of the side effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increase of the sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen , are sous-dosées while males are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the hormone somatotrope should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
the injection should be subcutaneous and the injection site should vary to avoid the onset of lipoatrophies .

in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 by T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and an increase in the serum concentration in T3 . 
in general , the peripheral levels of thyroid hormones remain within the reference normes healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on the rate of thyroid hormones may to have clinical consequences for patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique middle in which a anticipating metabolic hypothyroidism may develop .

the present time is not recommend the course of continued therapy , the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
if treatment 
14 with growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the onset of symptoms hypertension intracranial is required . 
in patients aged over 60 years of age , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be combined with energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with a syndrome of Prader- Willi , for signs of airway obstruction , the sleep apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of airway obstruction , the problem will be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea of subjective should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with consider reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie night , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of airway obstruction ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if apnoea of subjective is suspected . 
all patients had a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infection , which should be diagnosed as early as possible and effectively . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should also be done under control pondéral prior to and during treatment with growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop in a rapid growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of scoliose during treatment with growth hormone . 
the experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before starting treatment , then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , test hyperglycaemia been orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical event , growth hormone should not be given . 
if on measures , the haemoglobin 
15 of IGF-l are greater than 2 SD compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
the experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately before puberty in children / adolescents are small to age gestational is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy immediately before puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in paediatric patients are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final solution is reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal prior to initiating therapy . 
to be confirmed delayed , the growth advises should be followed to for one year before emergency treatment . 
during this period , the treatment of renal insufficiency ( including control of the acidosis hyperparathyroidism , and the condition nutritionnel ) should have been observed and should be held throughout the course of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued in the event of kidney transplantation . 
it is not known , to date , data available on the height permanent of patients with chronic renal failure patients treated with Omnitrope .

this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
due to the presence of benzyl alcohol , this medicinal product must not be given to prématurés to patients . 
it may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children aged less than 3 years . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of an interaction study performed in adult patients with a deficiency , growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : thyroid sex steroids , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and in section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there is no clinical experience of therapy in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animal studies on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in the event of pregnancy . 
16 When pregnancy normal , the levels of growth hormone adenoma decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the growth hormone placental to approximately 30 weeks . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary for deficiency growth hormone in women for the 3e trimester of pregnancy . 
it is not known whether the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
particular attention should be paid when Omnitrope is given to women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
undesirable effects 
a reduction of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is started , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as stiffness oedema , peripheral coldness , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these side effects are very severe to moderate , they occur within the first month of treatment and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and the age of patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in paediatric patients , these side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leukaemias have been reported in paediatric patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency is similar to those in children with no deficiency growth hormone 
immune system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine caused formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low , and their formation there is evidence of no clinical evidence . 
Endocrine disorders 
type 2 diabetes . 
nervous system disorders 
common : 
Uncommon : 
paraesthesia in the adulte. of nasolacrimal carpien syndrome in adults ; paraesthesia in the patient pédiatrique. intracranial bénigne hypertension . 
Muscoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
common : 
rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in adults . 
Uncommon : rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in paediatric patients . 
general disorders and administration site conditions 
common : 
skin reactions localised and passagères at the site of injection for paediatric patients . 
Uncommon : 
oedema peripheral in paediatric patients . 
overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the initial acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia , and then secondary to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , long term lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of the excess growth hormone in humans . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : thyroid of antéhypophyse and analogues . 
ATC code : 
the somatropine is a potent metabolic hormone signals important in the metabolism of lipid , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal by increasing the retention azotée in stimulating the growth of skeletal muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentration of IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties were observed . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of liver receptors , causing increases in LDL-cholesterol levels , and change the lipid profile and lipoprotéines serum levels . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone results in a decrease in LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum levels . 
a decrease in total cholesterol serum can also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
paediatric patients with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated with the administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the deficiency , growth hormone is associated with a decrease in plasma and volumes extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine results in a sodium retention , potassium and phosphorique . 
metabolism bone : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density in the body increase sites of long term administration of somatropine to patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
18 Forced physical : 
the strength muscle and the patient &apos;s ability to exercise are améliorées following long term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also enhances the rate of the heart , but the mechanism has not been elucidated . 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , strengths of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used for up to a final . 
data from the published literature suggest an late 0.5 SD in children / adolescents small to age gestational are not receiving and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety information is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
elimination The mean half-life of the terminal somatropine is approximately 0.4 hours after administration of intra- venous adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope , the half-life is reached 3 hours . 
sous-population The absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in the patients in male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients in the differential races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to this . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans subaiguë toxicity studies and local tolerance with Omnitrope revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other studies of general toxicity and local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the studies of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo mutation genetic technology and induction aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
there have been observed in a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients following long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the medicinal product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of these findings is not clear . 
in another study , there was no gullet chromosomal differences in the risk of patients who had been treated with the somatropine long-term use .

when a pregnancy normal , the levels of growth hormone adenoma decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the growth hormone placental to approximately 30 weeks . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary for deficiency growth hormone in women for the 3e trimester of pregnancy . 
it is not known whether the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
Omnitrope should only be given with caution in women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
undesirable effects 
a reduction of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is started , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as stiffness oedema , peripheral coldness , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these side effects are very severe to moderate , they occur within the first month of treatment and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and the age of patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in paediatric patients , these side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leukaemias have been reported in paediatric patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency is similar to those in children with no deficiency growth hormone . 
immune system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine resulted in the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré small and their formation there is evidence of no clinical evidence . 
Endocrine disorders 
type 2 diabetes . 
nervous system disorders

oedema peripheral in adults ; skin reactions localised and passagères at the site of injection for paediatric patients . 
Uncommon : 
oedema peripheral in paediatric patients . 
overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the initial acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia , and then secondary to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , long term lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of the excess growth hormone in humans . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : thyroid of antéhypophyse and analogues . 
ATC code : 
the somatropine is a potent metabolic hormone signals important in the metabolism of lipid , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal by increasing the retention azotée in stimulating the growth of skeletal muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentration of IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties were observed . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of liver receptors , causing increases in LDL-cholesterol levels , and change the lipid profile and lipoprotéines serum levels . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone results in a decrease in LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum levels . 
a decrease in total cholesterol serum can also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
paediatric patients with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated with the administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the deficiency , growth hormone is associated with a decrease in plasma and volumes extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine results in a sodium retention , potassium and phosphorique . 
28 metabolism bone : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density in the body increase sites of long term administration of somatropine to patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
exercise capacity : 
the strength muscle and the patient &apos;s ability to exercise are améliorées following long term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also enhances the rate of the heart , but the mechanism has not been elucidated . 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , strengths of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used for up to a final . 
data from the published literature suggest an late 0.5 SD in children / adolescents small to age gestational are not receiving and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety information is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
following administration by the subcutaneous route of a dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope headache General disorders mg / ml solution for injection in healthy adult values Cmax , respectively , and tmax are 72 28 g / l and 4.0 2.0 hours . 
elimination The mean terminal a half life of the somatropine is approximately 0.4 hours after administration of intra- venous adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope headache General disorders mg / ml solution for injection , the half-life is reached 3 hours . 
sous-population The absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in the patients in male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients in the differential races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to this . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans subaiguë toxicity studies and local tolerance with Omnitrope revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other studies of general toxicity and local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the studies of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo mutation genetic technology and induction aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
there have been observed in a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients following long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the medicinal product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of these findings is not clear . 
in another study , there was no gullet chromosomal differences in the risk of patients who had been treated with the somatropine long-term use .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
infants , children and adolescents 
- Retard growth consistent with a deficiency somatotrope 
- Retard growth related to a syndrome of Turner 
- Retard growth associated with chronic renal failure . 
- Retard growth ( height current &lt; - 2.5 SDS ( score standard déviation ) and size parentale 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by genetic test appropriate . 
adults 
- Treatment replacement therapy in adults with severe somatotrope deficiency . 
patients with a severe somatotrope acquis in adulthood are defined as a condition known hypothalamo-hypophysaire and at least one other hormone deficiency adenoma , except the prolactine . 
a single dynamic test should be performed to diagnostiquer or exclude a deficiency , growth hormone in these patients . 
the limits of tests dynamiques should only be swallowed defined . 
posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
posology and method of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were observed . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
paediatric patients with the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year , including épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
growth retardation in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure patients : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses can be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 ) . 
the recommended doses in paediatric patients : 
mg / kg body weight mg / m2 of body surface area Indication Déficit in growth hormone Tumour Prader-Willi Tumour Turner Renal impairment chronic Children / adolescents are small to age 
0.025 to 0.035 0.035 0,045 to 0.050 0,045 to 0.050 
0.7 to 1.0 1.0 1.4 1.4 
deficiency , growth hormone in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually over the needs of the patient , determined by the levels of IGF-1 yielding concentrations of IGF-1 , on the basis of age not above the upper 2 ) . 
patients with a IGF-1 is of normal at the beginning of treatment should be given the growth hormone up to a level of IGF-1 higher in the range of the normal range , not to exceed 2 ) . 
the clinical response of the side effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1.0 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increase of the sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens , are sous-dosées while males are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the hormone somatotrope should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
the injection should be subcutaneous and it is necessary to rotate the injection sites for the onset of lipoatrophies . 
33 &quot; Instructions for use and handling : see section 6.6 . 
Contre-indications 
- Hypersensitivity to the somatropine or to any of the excipients . 
- The somatropine should not be used in the event of tumour and any treatment activity . 
antitumour should be completed before starting treatment . 
- The somatropine should not be used to support the growth of patients whose 
- patients with a critique acute have complications being secondary to an 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine may induce a resistance and in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 by T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and an increase in the serum concentration in T3 . 
in general , the peripheral levels of thyroid hormones remain within the reference normes healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on the rate of thyroid hormones may to have clinical consequences for patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique middle in which a anticipating metabolic hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is especially advised control thyroid function by initiation of therapy with the somatropine and following dose adjustment . 
a decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this reduction may be related to changes transport proteins or to an increase in hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of deficiency somatotrope secondary to treatment together , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients who have problems with their endocriniens , including those relatifs to a deficiency , growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse of the hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe headache , or , visual , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of eye for a possible oedema papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if there is occurs , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
the present time is not recommend the course of continued therapy , the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
if treatment 
34 by growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the onset of symptoms hypertension intracranial is required . 
in patients aged over 60 years of age , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be combined with energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with a syndrome of Prader- Willi , for signs of airway obstruction , the sleep apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of airway obstruction , the problem will be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea of subjective should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with consider reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie night , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of airway obstruction ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if apnoea of subjective is suspected . 
all patients had a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infection , which should be diagnosed as early as possible and effectively . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should also be done under control pondéral prior to and during treatment with growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop in a rapid growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of scoliose during treatment with growth hormone . 
the experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before starting treatment , then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , test hyperglycaemia been orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical event , growth hormone should not be given . 
if on measures , the haemoglobin 
35 of IGF-l are greater than 2 SD compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
the experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately before puberty in paediatric patients are small to age gestational is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy immediately before puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final solution is reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal . 
prior to initiating therapy , to be confirmed delayed , the growth advises should be followed to for one year before emergency treatment . 
during this period , the treatment of renal insufficiency ( including control of the acidosis hyperparathyroidism , and the condition nutritionnel ) should have been observed and should be held throughout the course of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued in the event of kidney transplantation . 
it is not known , to date , data available on the height permanent of patients with chronic renal failure patients treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
due to the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients with a critique acute benefits of continuing treatment with somatropinedans this situation should be provided therapy with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a critique acute other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine should be provided therapy with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of an interaction study performed in adult patients with a deficiency , growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : thyroid sex steroids , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and in section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there are no data on the use of this product in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animal studies on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in the event of pregnancy . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine 
36 should not be necessary for deficiency growth hormone in women for the 3e trimester of pregnancy . 
it is not known whether the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
Omnitrope should only be given with caution in women who are breast-feeding .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , in combination with surgery and in addition to monitored endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of the reduction in the number and the size of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is two capsules of 200 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the recommended maximum daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by half ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
the experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is only limited experience , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications , 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
paediatric population : 
2 Métaboliseurs metabolisers CYP2C9 : 
patients who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspectés be on the basis of the génotype or history / experience with other substrates CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution because the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) has not been established . 
special precautions for may be warranted in these patients ( see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
Contre-indications 
- Maladie inflammatory intestine . 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , with the célécoxib has been studied in up to 6 months and has not been shown to decrease the risk of cancer gastrointestinal or another form of cancer or reduction in the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of monitoring endoscopique replacement should not be decreased to and during surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should not be delayed . 
gastrointestinal disorders Post-marketing high , gastrointestinal complications &#91; perforations , ulcers or haemorrhage ( PUH ) &#93; , some with fatal outcome have been observed in patients treated with célécoxib . 
there is a potentiation of the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) with a anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive of concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after careful consideration ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
because of their lack of antiplatelet effects , the COX-2 selective inhibitors are not cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular thromboembolic disease . 
therefore , agents anti-agrégants inhibitors should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema was reported in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics or in volume depletion . 
as with all NSAIDs , the célécoxib may lead to the development of a blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , the blood pressure should be closely monitored , at the start of treatment with célécoxib and throughout the course of treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , particular attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the imbalance impaired , renal or hepatic impairment and especially with cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical supervision should be established . 
renal and hepatic impairment The NSAIDs , the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
clinical studies performed with the célécoxib showed renal effects similar to those observed with NSAIDs comparator . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , an impaired liver function , and Cancer elderly patients . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
the experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 Posology and method of administration and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
4 Post-marketing appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration Cancer organs treatment mentioned during treatment . 
the risk of any of these effects appear to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment . 
severe hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 Undesirable effects ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or to any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued the first sign of skin rash , mucosal lining or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Patients known to be of poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin , haemorrhage serious were reported . 
caution should be taken in case of a combination of célécoxib with warfarin or other anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules to Onsenal 200 mg contain lactose ( 49,8 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the LAPP lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction The majority interaction studies have been conducted with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg twice daily ( such as those observed in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice daily cannot be excluded . 
the potency anti-clotting should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , in particular the first few days following the initiation or change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , the dose of oral anticoagulants , should be accompanied by a close monitoring of prothrombin time INR of patients . 
NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , and in patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic . 
an increase in the nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked concomitant use of NSAIDs with derivatives ciclosporin D or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored in case of a combination of célécoxib with any of these medicinal products . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but it may cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular . 
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
pharmacokinetic interactions 
effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products The célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate CYP2D6 , increased by 136 . 
the plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of the enzyme may be used in combination with the célécoxib . 
MEDICINAL products metabolised by CYP2D6 are , for example , tricyclic antidepressants ( and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotonin ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of CYP2D6 substrates with a dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if needed at the start of treatment with the célécoxib or increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies have shown that the célécoxib was may inhibit the cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is not known . 
MEDICINAL products metabolised by CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study , the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg of noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl estradiol ) . 
the célécoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or the glyburide in clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters ( plasma clearance or renal ) , methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of the toxicity related to methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
in healthy subjects , the concomitant administration of 200 mg twice a day , célécoxib with 450 mg twice a day lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 Cmax and 18 AUC lithium . 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be closely monitored during the introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
6 In patients who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and which have an increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due to exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 , it should be used to half of the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
the concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg of célécoxib and 200 mg once a day , fluconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean increase in Cmax 60 and the AUC of 130 of célécoxib . 
the concomitant use with of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction Contre-indications ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 Preclinical safety data ) . 
the potential risk for the Use is unknown . 
as with other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , célécoxib may lead to inertie utérine and closure prématurée of nasolacrimal artériel during the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding to become pregnant during therapy , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma . 
administration of célécoxib to a limited number of women who are breast-feeding showed a very low levels of whether célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
these studies have not been performed to determine the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
undesirable effects 
undesirable effects are listed , by system organ class and by frequency listed in Table 1 , on the basis of the data sources of the following : 
- The adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as comparator NSAIDs beta- blocking agents , approximately 7400 arthritiques patients were treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
the side effects reported with the célécoxib in these studies information were consistent with biochemical marker evidence those in patients with rheumatoid arthritis arthrose and Table 1 . 
- The adverse reactions reported spontaneously post marketing experience , period in 
how long it is estimated to &gt; 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and instructions ) . 
as all side effects were not reported in the MAH and included in the data , it is difficult to determine reliable of the frequency of these side effects .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
antinéoplasiques , ATC code : 
the célécoxib is a derivative of pyrazole substitué by two groupements aryl analogue chemical other sulphonamides non-arylaminiques ( e. g. thiazides , furosémide ) , but differently of sulphonamides arylaminiques ( e. g. sulfamethoxazole and other antibiotics sulphonamides ) . 
the célécoxib is a selective inhibitor of the oral cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
no statistically significant inhibition of the COX-1 ( evaluated by the ex-vivo inhibition of the formation of thromboxane B2 &#91; TxB2 &#93; ) was observed in healthy volunteers at the therapeutic dose , familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , 400 mg twice a day . 
the cyclo-oxygénase is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins . 
two isoforms , COX-1 and COX-2 , have been identified . 
the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) is the predominant of the enzyme induced by a stimulus cytokines and is supposée be the major responsible for the synthesis of prostanoïdes mediators of pain , inflammation , and fever . 
high levels of COX-2 are found in there lesions pré-malignes ( such as polyps adénomateux colorectaux ) and cancers épithéliaux . 
the familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is a disease genetic from alteration genetic autosomale dominante of gene suppresseur of tumour , gene APC ( Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ) . 
the polyps with of gene mutation APC and not treated surexprimant the COX-2 , continue of form and occur in the colon or rectum with a risk of progression to a colon or rectum 100 . 
the COX-2 is also involved in ovulation , implantation and closure of the nasolacrimal artériel , régulation renal function , and some central nervous system functions ( fever induction , pain perception and cognitive function ) . 
it may also play an in the risk of ulcers . 
the COX-2 has been found in the in tissue around gastric ulcers in man but its implication in the risk of ulcers has not been established . 
the difference in antiplaquettaire activity between some COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs and in the COX-2 selective inhibitors may have a clinical significance in patients at risk of thromboembolic reactions . 
COX-2 inhibitors reduce the formation of systemic prostacycline ( and therefore possibly endothelial ) , to affect the platelet thromboxane . 
an effect on the formation of TxB2 was observed after high doses of célécoxib . 
however , in healthy subjects and in studies with low effectif , multiple-dose with 600 mg twice daily , the célécoxib had no effect on platelet aggregation , nor on the time of bleeding , compared with placebo . 
inhibition of the COX-2 may affect the viability of the tumour without associated with inflammation . 
the célécoxib inhibits the formation of tumours in the cancer preclinical models of the colon , which surexpriment the COX-2 , induites chimiquement ( in the rat model AOM ) or by the model genetic mutation assay ( mouse MIN ) . 
it was shown that the célécoxib to reduce the number and the size of polyps adénomateux colorectaux . 
a controlled , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , has been performed in 83 patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . 
the study population consisted of 58 patients who have had previously a partial or colectomie total and 25 patients had a colon intact . 
thirteen subjects had a phenotype atténué for the familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . 
a significant reduction of the surface adenomatous duodénale has also been observed as compared to placebo ( 14,5 with the célécoxib 400 mg twice daily versus 1.4 with placebo ) , however was not statistically significant . 
the results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of polyps in all treatment groups the célécoxib compared to the groups correspondants treated with placebo . 
reducing the higher has been observed in patients treated with the célécoxib at doses of 16 mg / kg / day , which corresponds to the recommended dose of 800 mg daily in adult patients with a FAP . 
the safety , have been examined in list by the Committee for independent , with monitoring conclu that the dose of célécoxib of 16 mg / kg / day was a dose safely to recommend for futures studies in adolescents with FAP . 
cardiovascular safety long-term studies involving of subjects who polyps adénomateux sporadiques : 
two studies in healthy subjects who polyps adénomateux sporadiques have been conducted with the célécoxib , the clinical trial APC ( prevention of adénome by the célécoxib ) and the clinical trial PreSAP ( prevention of polyps adénomateux spontaneous ) . 
the clinical trial APC has shown a dose-dependent increase of the composite ( expertisé ) and death cardiovascular , myocardial infarction or stroke with the célécoxib compared with placebo for 3 years of treatment . 
the clinical trial PreSAP did not show any statistically significant increase the risk to the same composite endpoint . 
the combined for this composite over 3 years were 3.0 ( 20 cases / 671 subjects ) and 2.5 ( 17 cases / 685 subjects ) , against 0.9 ( 6 cases / 679 subjects ) for placebo . 
increases in both groups célécoxib and placebo , when expliquent primarily by an increased incidence of myocardial infarction . 
in the clinical trial PreSAP the relative risk compared with placebo for the same composite ( expertisé ) was 1.2 ( 95 CI 0.6 2.4 ) with a daily dose of 400 mg célécoxib compared to placebo . 
the combined for this composite over 3 years were 2.3 ( 21 cases / 933 subjects ) , and 1.9 ( 12 cases / 628 subjects ) . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction ( expertisé ) was 1.0 ( 9 subjects / 933 ) with a daily dose of 400 mg célécoxib , compared to 0.6 ( 4 cases / 628 subjects ) with placebo . 
data from a third study long-term called ADAPT ( The Alzheimer&apos; Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial ) have not revealed no significant increase in the cardiovascular risk associated with the twice-daily 200 mg of célécoxib compared to placebo . 
the relative risk compared with placebo for a composite similar ( death of CV , MI , stroke ) was 1,14 ( 95 CI 0.61 2.12 ) with a twice-daily 200 mg of célécoxib . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction was 1.1 ( 8 cases / 717 patients ) with a twice-daily 200 mg of célécoxib , compared with 1.2 ( 13 cases / 1070 patients ) with placebo . 
data from pooled tests randomised controlled trials suggest also that the cardiovascular risk may be associated with the use of célécoxib compared to placebo , indicating differences in the risk of the dose of célécoxib .

the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information which may be provided as necessary , and this SPC will be provided to day . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the célécoxib is well absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to 3 hours approximately . 
the taken with food ( high fat meal ) delays the absorption of approximately 1 hour with an increase in the absorption total exposure ( AUC ) of 10 to 20 . 
the célécoxib is primarily eliminated by metabolism . 
less than 1 of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine . 
inter-sujets variability in exposure to célécoxib is approximately factor 10 . 
at therapeutic doses , the pharmacokinetic profile célécoxib was independent of the time and dose . 
plasma protein binding is approximately 97 at therapeutic concentrations , and the célécoxib is not préférentiellement bound erythrocytes . 
the elimination half-life ranges from 8 to 12 hours . 
steady-state plasma concentrations are reached in less than 5 days of treatment . 
the pharmacological activity is attributed to the parent . 
main human metabolites present in the circulation did not activity décelable on the COX-1 or COX-2 . 
the metabolism of célécoxib is mainly bound to cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 . 
three metabolites , inactive as inhibitors COX-1 and COX-2 , have been identified in human plasma , a alcohol primary , carboxylique corresponding and its glucuronide conjugate . 
the activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 is reduced in patients with a polymorphisme genetic with to reduce the effect of enzymatic activity , as with any variantes homozygous of polymorphisme CYP2C9 3 . 
in three studies were conducted in 5 of subjects distinctes génotype CYP2C9 3 / 3 , AUC 0-24 of a single dose was increased to 3 times approximately compared to normal CYP2D6 . 
it is estimated to 0.3 to 1.0 the frequency of génotype 3 / 3 homozygote of different groups ethniques . 
patients who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspectés be on the basis of the history / experience with other substrates CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution ( see section 4.2 ) . 
there were no differences in clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of célécoxib between the populations afro-américaine and Caucasian . 
when a dose of 200 mg per day is given , gave in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41 and 146 . 
in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment , the metabolic capacity was well related to their levels of serum albumin . 
in patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25-35 g / l ) , the daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 . 
patients with severe hepatic impairment ( serum albumin &lt; 25g / l ) have not been studied , célécoxib is contraindicated in these patients . 
13 The pharmacokinetics of célécoxib has not been studied in patients with impaired renal function , but it should not be changed to influence in these patients , because it is extensively metabolised by the liver . 
there are limited data on the use of célécoxib in renal impairment and therefore , caution is recommended when treating patients with renal impairment . 
severe renal impairment is contraindication . 
preclinical safety data 
of hernies diaphragmatiques were also seen in a study of toxicity péri- and the natale in rats , which included a exposure to product during the period of organogenèse . 
in the final study , at the lower systemic exposure for this abnormal occurred in one animal , the safety margin about was estimated to be 2 times the recommended daily dose in humans ( 800 mg ) .

therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , in combination with surgery and in addition to monitored endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of the reduction in the number and the size of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is one capsule of 400 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the recommended maximum daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by half ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
the experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is only limited experience , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications , 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
paediatric population : 
16 Métaboliseurs metabolisers CYP2C9 : 
patients who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspectés be on the basis of the génotype or history / experience with other substrates CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution because the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) has not been established . 
special precautions for may be warranted in these patients ( see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
Contre-indications 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , with the célécoxib has been studied in up to 6 months and has not been shown to decrease the risk of cancer gastrointestinal or another form of cancer or reduction in the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of monitoring endoscopique replacement should not be decreased to and during surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) should not be delayed . 
there is a potentiation of the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
a significant differences in the gastrointestinal tolerability of the combination of the COX-2 selective inhibitors / acetylsalicylic acid , and the combination NSAIDs / acetylsalicylic acid has not been demonstrated in clinical trials long-term ( see section 5.1 ) . 
17 The combination of célécoxib and an NSAID other than aspirin should be avoided . 
patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) with a anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive of concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after careful consideration ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
because of their lack of inhibitors , the effects of the COX-2 selective inhibitors are not cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular thromboembolic disease . 
therefore , agents anti-agrégant inhibitors should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema was reported in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics or in volume depletion . 
as with all NSAIDs , the célécoxib may lead to the development of a blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , the blood pressure should be closely monitored , at the start of treatment with célécoxib and throughout the course of treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , particular attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the imbalance impaired , renal or hepatic impairment and especially with cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical supervision should be established . 
renal and hepatic impairment The NSAIDs , the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
clinical studies performed with the célécoxib showed renal effects similar to those observed with NSAIDs comparator . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , an impaired liver function , and Cancer elderly patients . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
18 The experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
the appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration Cancer one of the organs treatment mentioned during treatment . 
skin reactions serious skin reactions , some with fatal outcome , as the dermatitis exfoliative , Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( toxic epidermal necrolysis , have been very rarely reported in association with the use of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the risk of any of these effects appear to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment . 
severe hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or to any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued the first sign of skin rash , mucosal lining or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Patients known to be of poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin serious haemorrhage have been reported . 
caution should be exercised when concomitant administration of célécoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules to Onsenal 400 mg contain lactose ( 99,6 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the LAPP lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction The majority interaction studies have been conducted with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg twice daily ( such as those observed in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice daily cannot be excluded . 
the potency anti-clotting should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , in particular the first few days following the initiation or change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , the dose of oral anticoagulants , should be accompanied by a close monitoring of prothrombin time INR of patients . 
19 The NSAIDs may reduce the effect of diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , and in patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic . 
an increase in the nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked concomitant use of NSAIDs with derivatives ciclosporin D or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored in case of a combination of célécoxib with any of these medicinal products . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but it may cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular . 
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) .

effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products The célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate CYP2D6 , increased by 136 . 
the plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of the enzyme may be used in combination with the célécoxib . 
MEDICINAL products metabolised by CYP2D6 are , for example , tricyclic antidepressants ( and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotonin ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of CYP2D6 substrates with a dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if needed at the start of treatment with the célécoxib or increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies have shown that the célécoxib was may inhibit the cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is not known . 
MEDICINAL products metabolised by CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study , the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg of noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl estradiol ) . 
the célécoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or the glyburide in clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters ( plasma clearance or renal ) , methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of the toxicity related to methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
20 In healthy subjects , the concomitant administration of 200 mg twice a day , célécoxib with 450 mg twice a day lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 Cmax and 18 AUC lithium . 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be closely monitored during the introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
in patients who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and which have an increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due to exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 , it should be used to half of the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
the concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg of célécoxib and 200 mg once a day , fluconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean increase in Cmax 60 and the AUC of 130 of célécoxib . 
the concomitant use with of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction Contre-indications ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 Preclinical safety data ) . 
the potential risk for the Use is unknown . 
as with other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , célécoxib may lead to inertie utérine and closure prématurée of nasolacrimal artériel during the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding to become pregnant during therapy , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma . 
administration of célécoxib to a limited number of women who are breast-feeding showed a very low levels of whether célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
these studies have not been performed to determine the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
undesirable effects are listed , by system organ class and by frequency listed in Table 1 , on the basis of the data sources of the following : 
- The adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as comparator NSAIDs beta- blocking agents , approximately 7400 arthritiques patients were treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
- The adverse reactions reported spontaneously post marketing experience , period in 
how long it is estimated to &gt; 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and instructions ) . 
as all side effects were not reported in the MAH and included in the data , it is difficult to determine reliable of the frequency of these side effects .
