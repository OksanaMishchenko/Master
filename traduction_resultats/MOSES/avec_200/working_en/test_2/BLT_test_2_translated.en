hypersensitivity to the active substance , to arachides or soya or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average dose 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
however , the clinical experience 
49 the olanzapine is limited in patients with with disease , caution is recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
50 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take these tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
51 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

54 6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly .

during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
55 significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
56 There is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
57 In patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
58 In healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
59 In studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
64 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
65 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take these tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
66 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

69 6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
70 significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite .

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
72 In patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
73 In healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
74 In studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
mutagenicity 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients .

efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
however , the clinical experience 
79 the olanzapine is limited in patients with with disease , caution is recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
80 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take these tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
81 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
85 Last within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 nervous system disorders Very common : 
( including sedation hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
88 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
89 prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , a malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
4 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors VTE , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
rare cases of 
5 seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
6 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment .

in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
10 Children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A limit to 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
14 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity Based results studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose .

Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
20 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors VTE , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
rare cases of 
21 seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
22 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment .

in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
26 Children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A limit to 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
30 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity Based results studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together .

special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , a malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
36 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors VTE , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
rare cases of 
37 seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
38 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment .

in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
42 Children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A limit to 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
46 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity Based results studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
51 Post-marketing adverse events ( such as vascular brain cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
52 Normal hepatic Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors VTE , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
53 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
54 potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

57 initiation of therapy ( 1.69 mmol / l- &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26 mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
58 An clinically relevant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite .

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
59 Treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
61 THE olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 62 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity Based results studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine may be 
65 administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age &gt; 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , a malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
67 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , iléus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors VTE , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
rare cases of 
68 seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose The OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
69 symptoms fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69 mmol / l- &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26 mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
73 Children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 disorders systeme disorders Very common :

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms In case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose There is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A limit to 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
77 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) The signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in repeated dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity THE olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
mutagenicity THE olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity Based results studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
2 Children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
3 Benzalkonium language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
4 Normal hepatic Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
5 Dyskinésie Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
6 potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
10 8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
11 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 nervous system disorders Very common : 
( including sedation hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
12 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
13 combination with lithium or valproate ) , resulted in after 6 weeks , a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
14 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
15 prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
18 Children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
19 Post-marketing adverse events ( such as vascular brain cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipidiquesDes lipid abnormalities have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
20 symptoms suggesting of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported during concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
21 postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

an increase in weight equal or greater than 25 compared to baseline body weight was very common in a prolonged use . 
2 The mean increases lipid levels fasting ( total cholesterol , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides ) were higher in patients without signs of cloudy lipids at the beginning of treatment . 
3 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.17mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 6.2mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 6.2mmol / l ) was very common . 
4 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.56mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 7mmol / l ) . 
an increase in fasting blood glucose with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.56- &lt; 7mmol / l ) to a high value ( 7mmol / l ) was very common .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs .

in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been commonly rapportésLors the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
27 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 nervous system disorders Very common : 
( including sedation hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
28 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
29 combination with lithium or valproate ) , resulted in after 6 weeks , a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
30 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
31 prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
35 Post-marketing adverse events ( such as vascular brain cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergiqueBien activity that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
36 with elevations of ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
37 postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

weight gain clinically significant , has been observed in all categories of body mildly hypocaloric starting ( BMI ) . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight was very frequently and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 25 compared to baseline body weight was very common in a prolonged use . 
2 The mean increases lipid levels fasting ( total cholesterol , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides ) were higher in patients without signs of cloudy lipids at the beginning of treatment . 
3 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.17mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 6.2mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 6.2mmol / l ) was very common . 
4 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.56mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 7mmol / l ) . 
an increase in fasting blood glucose with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.56- &lt; 7mmol / l ) to a high value ( 7mmol / l ) was very common . 
5 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 1.69mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 2.26mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
42 8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
43 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
increase in blood cholesterol levels 11 nervous system disorders Very common : 
( including sedation hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
44 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
45 combination with lithium or valproate ) , resulted in after 6 weeks , a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
46 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
47 prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
51 Post-marketing adverse events ( such as vascular brain cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel with autraitement antipsychotics . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
52 with elevations of ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
53 postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interaction expected is not recommended as this could be 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

weight gain clinically significant , has been observed in all categories of body mildly hypocaloric starting ( BMI ) . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight was very frequently and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 25 compared to baseline body weight was very common in a prolonged use . 
2 The mean increases lipid levels fasting ( total cholesterol , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides ) were higher in patients without signs of cloudy lipids at the beginning of treatment . 
3 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.17mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 6.2mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 6.2mmol / l ) was very common . 
4 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.56mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 7mmol / l ) . 
an increase in fasting blood glucose with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.56- &lt; 7mmol / l ) to a high value ( 7mmol / l ) was very common . 
5 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 1.69mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 2.26mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
58 8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapineDes pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
60 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
in a study in patients receiving lithium or valproate since at least two weeks , the introduction of 10 mg olanzapine ( in 
61 combination with lithium or valproate ) , resulted in after 6 weeks , a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
62 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
63 prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
67 Post-marketing adverse events ( such as vascular brain cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
68 with elevations of ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
69 hypotension postural An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interaction expected is not recommended as this could be 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight was very frequently and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 25 compared to baseline body weight was very common in a prolonged use . 
2 The mean increases lipid levels fasting ( total cholesterol , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides ) were higher in patients without signs of cloudy lipids at the beginning of treatment . 
3 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.17mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 6.2mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 6.2mmol / l ) was very common . 
4 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.56mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 7mmol / l ) . 
an increase in fasting blood glucose with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.56- &lt; 7mmol / l ) to a high value ( 7mmol / l ) was very common .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
74 Use hard capsules ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
76 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
77 combination with lithium or valproate ) , resulted in after 6 weeks , a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
78 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
79 prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
adults The olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
83 Post-marketing adverse events ( such as vascular brain cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
84 with elevations of ALT and / or AST , in patients with signs and symptoms suggesting of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicinal products potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension 85 An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interaction expected is not recommended as this could be 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

weight gain clinically significant , has been observed in all categories of body mildly hypocaloric starting ( BMI ) . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight was very frequently and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
an increase in weight equal or greater than 25 compared to baseline body weight was very common in a prolonged use . 
2 The mean increases lipid levels fasting ( total cholesterol , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides ) were higher in patients without signs of cloudy lipids at the beginning of treatment . 
3 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.17mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 6.2mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 6.2mmol / l ) was very common . 
4 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.56mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 7mmol / l ) . 
an increase in fasting blood glucose with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.56- &lt; 7mmol / l ) to a high value ( 7mmol / l ) was very common . 
5 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 1.69mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 2.26mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
90 Use hard capsules ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
91 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite .

Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
92 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers .

Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and depressive to 6 and 12 weeks . 
93 combination with lithium or valproate ) , resulted in after 6 weeks , a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the CYP P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 cause the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
94 In women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
CI prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

the dosage and frequency of administration of this Pharmaceutical are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose .

if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant , was 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
101 emboliques venous , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , orodispersible tablet , contains tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) , which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
102 clinical are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
103 In a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
106 8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
107 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :

Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
108 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers .

the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
110 In healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
the tablet orodispersible Olanzapine Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and thus easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to remove intact the orodispersible tablet . 
the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it can also be dissolved in a large glass of water or in other liquid adjusted ( orange juice , milk , juice pomme or chew ) immediately prior to administration . 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dosage and frequency of administration of this Pharmaceutical are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see ruvrique 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
116 Changes lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
117 general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
in studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies treatment-emergent was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
118 The mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
122 Use hard capsules ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
123 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common :

9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
124 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
126 In healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
130 The orodispersible tablet Olanzapine Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and thus easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to remove intact the orodispersible tablet . 
the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it can also be dissolved in a large glass of water or in other liquid adjusted ( orange juice , milk , juice pomme or chew ) immediately prior to administration . 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dosage and frequency of administration of this Pharmaceutical are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see ruvrique 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
132 Changes lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
133 activity general centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies treatment-emergent was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
yellow orangé S ( E110 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , orodispersible tablet contains of yellow orangé S ( E110 ) , which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
134 Inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

an increase in weight equal or greater than 25 compared to baseline body weight was very common in a prolonged use . 
2 The mean increases lipid levels fasting ( total cholesterol , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides ) were higher in patients without signs of cloudy lipids at the beginning of treatment . 
3 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.17mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 6.2mmol / l ) . 
increased levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.17- &lt; 6.2mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 6.2mmol / l ) was very common . 
4 Observée for levels fasting normal upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 5.56mmol / l ) , which are who had become high ( 7mmol / l ) . 
an increase in fasting blood glucose with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 5.56- &lt; 7mmol / l ) to a high value ( 7mmol / l ) was very common .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of movement 138 abnormal symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine ; Post-marketing pneumonia , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
139 The frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite . 
common : 
nervous system disorders Very common : 
( including sedation hypersomnia , lethargy , drowsiness ) gastrointestinal disorders Common : 
dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders Very common : 
elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and assistance 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine or another bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also exhibited of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
142 In healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

in patients with originally responded to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of manic moderate to severe . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode maniaque : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
prevention recurrence in bipolar disorder : 
the recommended initial dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prevention recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
according to the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of the olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase with higher doses than the recommended initial dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine can be administered with or without food , food has not of incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of the olanzapine . 
the tablet orodispersible Olanzapine Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and thus easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to remove intact the orodispersible tablet . 
the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it can also be dissolved in a large glass of water or in other liquid adjusted ( orange juice , milk , juice pomme or chew ) immediately prior to administration . 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dosage and frequency of administration of this Pharmaceutical are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to the Pharmaceutical tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents The use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and prolactine levels have been reported by a magnitude higher in the short-term studies in patients adolescents topotecan-treated studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients A lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
renal impairment and / or hepatic impairment An lower starting dose ( 5 mg daily ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking The initial dose and the dose range of does not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the imbalance more one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase adjustment should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
in a antipsychotic therapy , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days or weeks . 
patients should be closely monitored during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mid dose daily 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
language vascular adverse events ( such as cerebrovascular accidents , transient ischemic ) , some of which to fatal , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more language vascular adverse events have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who experienced an event brain vascular had of pre-existing risk factors . 
age &gt; 75 years and dementia type vascular or mixed have been identified as predisposing risk of adverse events in the brain vascular olanzapine group . 
efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson &apos;s disease The use of the olanzapine to patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( agoniste dopaminergic ) and resume the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) The Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques syndrome ( NMS ) is a potentially mortel in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Stevens-Johnson Malin of Neuroleptiques ( NMS ) have also been there under olanzapine . 
clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of autonomic neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . 
may include signs such as elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative of NMS or not there hyperpyrexia unexplained other signs of NMS , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes There hyperglycaemia and rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or with coma , in some cases fatal , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain wall , which may be a factor prédisposant has been reported . 
appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with predisposing risk may favoriser the development of diabetes for whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
two Changes lipid Post-marketing administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed of necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with lipid problems and in patients with risk factors may favoriser the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Although the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Post-marketing elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were frequently observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALT and / or AST during treatment should be monitored and consider require a dosage reduction . 
in the case hepatitis was diagnosed ( including of liver injury , or mixed cytolytiques cholestatiques ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinue therapy Post-marketing acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
reached Events Post-marketing reached Events Vein have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however , patients schizophrenia with often risk factors thrombo- venous emboliques , any factor of potential risk of reached Events Vein ( such the immobilisation prolonged ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
149 general activity centrally acting on the effects of the main Compte-tenu olanzapine on the centrally acting , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with action middle and with alcohol . 
due to its antagonist activity of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the agonists indirect harmful effects direct and dopamine . 
seizures THE olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general lower their limit convulsif . 
rare cases of seizure were reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it are either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive Dyskinesia In studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies treatment-emergent was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of tardive Dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive Dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or same occur after discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension An postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , mutagenicity tests and elevations metabolic parameters blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the backing recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
possible interactions with an effect on the olanzapine THE olanzapine is metabolised by the cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical that primarily stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
induction of CYP1A2 The metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the olanzapine . 
mild to moderate alone increased clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 It has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of the olanzapine . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean increase the Cmax of the olanzapine of 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
150 THE mean AUC of the olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower the olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
a dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability The charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , stearate ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of the olanzapine . 
the potential effects of olanzapine on other medicinal products THE olanzapine may antagoniser direct and indirect harmful effects of agonists . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit the major of CYP450 isoenzymes in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of therapy with the olanzapine . 
general activity on the centrally acting The caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with disease parkinson and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
QTc interval Caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with the olanzapine . 
however , the limited experience in women , olanzapine should only be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of dams treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study in healthy women from allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
average exposure neonates to steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by the mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and dizziness , patients should be warned on this risk when operating machines , including driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of possible side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests derived from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to baseline values ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 In clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients treated with olanzapine had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol at doses similar . 
in the absence of information on the précise history of abnormal movements symptoms of acute or Dyskinesia , cannot reached at this day as olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes symptoms tardifs . 
7 Post-marketing symptoms acute such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
154 8 Post-marketing clinical evidence related ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
prolonged use ( at least 48 weeks ) The proportion of patients who experienced side changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have strict 9 -12 months of treatment , the mean increased blood decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
information on special populations In clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an incidence limit of death and vascular adverse events language compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
a Gait disturbance Feeling cold abnormal and falls were very commonly reported adverse events with olanzapine . 
interstitial , increased body temperature , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
during clinical trials in patients with parkinsoniens illnesses drug ( agonists ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported and this , necessary more frequently , than with placebo . 
during a clinical trial performed in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; factor potential contributif may be plasma levels high valproate . 
an increase greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite and weight gain was observed in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of the olanzapine lithium or at valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents THE olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been performed , data from studies performed in adolescents was compared to those trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared to adult patients with a comparable exposure . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a short exposure . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
155 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Very common : 
weight gain 9 increased , blood triglycéridémie10 , increased appetite .

elevations of liver enzymes ( AST , ALT ; see section 4.4 ) . 
Investigations Very common : 
decreased total bilirubin increased , blood Gamma Globuline Transférase , Increased prolactinémie 12 . 
9 An increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared to baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared to baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to initiation of therapy . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a normal level upon initiation of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes levels of total cholesterol fasting with a baseline upper upon initiation of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , EPS various and a decrease in the level of consciousness ranging from sedation at coma . 
clinically significant other effects of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse route , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote the olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
management Deviation of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be instituted according to the clinical condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and respiratory . 
- 156 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
a cardiovascular monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
a close medical supervision and monitoring should be continued until the patient recovers . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , code ATC N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a broad pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , and cholinergiques , which support the profile binding receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that the olanzapine had a greater affinity for serotonin receptors 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that the olanzapine reduced necessary selective transmission in neurones dopaminergiques system modulates ( A10 ) whilst the observed effect on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement test supplied , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those responsible for induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the occurrence of side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to an of test &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A than receptors D2 . 
in patients experiencing mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , the olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine group compared to placebo was observed for the primary adjudicated recurrence in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight significantly compared to adults . 
the magnitude changes fasting levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , increases in LDL cholesterol levels and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety at long-term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the film-coated tablets olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , peak plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it does not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than that the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , olanzapine . 
following oral administration , the mean terminal elimination half-life of the olanzapine in healthy subjects varies depending on age and gender . 
158 In healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) , relative to young healthy subjects , the mean half-life of elimination olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
pharmacokinetic variability in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the younger patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse events profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is slightly hard capsules ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , studies of test mass have shown that approximately 57 a dose of olanzapine radioactive were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance is reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of the olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , and clearance of smoking , on the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including Caucasian , Japanese and ovary , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attaching the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and the acid 1-glycoprotéine . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13-17 years ) : pharmacokinetic parameters of the olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean of exposure to olanzapine was approximately limit 27 in adolescents . 
the demographic differences between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a number least important smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are neuroleptics characteristics potent : hypoactivity , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and increased heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have been associated with an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were CNS depression , and anticholinergiques peripheral haematological problems . 
a safety appeared for depression CNS . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in rats included decrease the weight of ovaries and utérus , changes morphologiques epithelium vaginal and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects were observed in each of species , including reductions in the number of circulating leucocytes dose-dépendantes in mice and decreases of specific leucocytes circulating in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité fibrosis have shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on or prolifératives progenitor cells in the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation had any effect on the ability of impair mating male . 
in the portées of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development and a transient decrease in small activity were observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation testing bacterial , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenic potential .

growth hormone deficiency in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose , 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually in the needs of the patient , determined by the rate of IGF-1 yielding concentrations of IGF-1 , on the basis of age not above the upper 2 SD . 
patients with the rise in IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should receive the growth hormone up to achieve an rate of IGF-1 higher in the range of normal , without exceed 2 SD . 
the clinical response well as the side effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1 mg per day . 
women may need of doses higher than men ; men with increased sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with substitution therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen , are sous-dosées whereas men are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the somatotrope hormone should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
3 THE injection should be subcutaneous and the injection site should vary to avoid the onset of lipoatrophies . 
instructions for use and handling see section 6.6 . 
Contre-indications 
- Hypersensitivity to the somatropine or any of the excipients . 
- The somatropine should not be used in case of tumour and activity any treatment 
antitumour should be completed before instituting therapy . 
- The somatropine should not be used to support the growth of patients whose 
- The patients with a critique acute have complications being secondary to a 
surgery to heart debossed opened abdominal surgery , a polytraumatisme , a acute respiratory failure , or similar situation should not be treated with the growth hormone . 
for patients receiving replacement therapy , refer to section 4.4 . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine can cause resistance as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes could be established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , may be allowed to affect the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , increased the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and serum concentrations in T3 . 
usually , peripheral levels of thyroid hormones remain in the reference normes healthy subjects . 
the effects of somatropine on the rate of thyroid hormones may have a clinical consequences in patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique middle in which a anticipating metabolic hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , a hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is therefore particularly recommended control thyroid function after vena treatment with the somatropine and after dosage . 
decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this reduction may be related to the changes transport proteins or to increased hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of deficiency somatotrope secondary to treatment together , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with enrolling endocriniennes , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of headache severe , or , visual , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of oeil for a possible swelling papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if there is occurs , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
4 recommend the continued treatment with growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
however , the clinical experience showed that the réintroduction treatment was often possible without récurrence intracranial of hypertension . 
if treatment with the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of symptoms hypertension intracranial is necessary . 
in patients aged over 60 years , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome , treatment should always be associated with a energy-restricted diet . 
patients experiencing SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with a Prader- syndrome , a Willi titration signs of airway obstruction , of subjective apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of airway obstruction , the problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea of subjective should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with consider reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during night monitored , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of airway obstruction ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea of subjective is suspected . 
all patients had a Prader-Willi syndrome should be monitored for signs of infections Respiratory , which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated effectively . 
all patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi should also be pondéral control before and during treatment with the growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome . 
in all children , the scoliose can develop in a growth regular . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of scoliose during treatment with the growth hormone . 
experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before instituting therapy then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a hyperglycaemia been test orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical develops , the growth hormone should not be administered . 
5 In children / adolescents are small for age gestational , it is recommended to measure the levels of IGF-l prior to initiating therapy , and subsequently 2 times per year . 
if on measures , the rate of IGF-l are greater than 2 SD compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , the ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately before puberty in children are small for age gestational is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy immediately before puberty . 
the experience in patients with glucose-galactose Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents are small for age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final size is reached . 
in the case of renal impairment , renal function should be decreased 50 compared to normal prior to initiating therapy . 
to be confirmed delayed growth , advises growth should be followed in the past during one year before emergency treatment . 
during this period , treatment of renal impairment ( including control acidosis hyperparathyroidism the , and the condition nutritionnel ) should have been initiated and should be held for the duration of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued if kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent patients with chronic renal failure treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
based on the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients with a critique acute benefits of continuing treatment in this situation should be provided as therapy with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a condition acute critique other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine should be provided as therapy with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on results of an interaction study performed in adults with deficiency growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical consequence of this finding is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by estrogens . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there is no clinical experience of therapy in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animals regarding the toxicity of Omnitrope on reproductive are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in pregnancy . 
in a pregnancy normal , the rate of growth hormone adenoma decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the hormone 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary for deficiency growth hormone in women for the 3e trimester of pregnancy . 
it is not known that the somatropine passes into human milk ; however gastrointestinal intestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
particular attention should be paid when Omnitrope is administered to women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects of on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
undesirable effects 
decrease of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with growth hormone deficiency . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is initiated , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , extremities rigidity , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these side effects are Uncommon severe to moderate , they occur in the first months of therapy and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and age patients ; it can be conversely related to age patients in the onset of growth hormone deficiency . 
in paediatric patients , such side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leukaemias have been reported in paediatric patients atteintsd&apos; growth hormone deficiency and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency appears similar to those in children with no growth hormone deficiency . 
immune system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine caused antibody formation in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low , and their formation is evidence of no clinical evidence . 
Endocrine disorders 
type 2 diabetes .

overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia initially , then secondary to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , long term lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of the excess of growth hormone in humans . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : thyroid of the antéhypophyse and analogues . 
ATC code : 
the somatropine is a potent metabolic hormone signals important in the metabolism lipids , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with growth hormone deficiency . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing the retention azotée , in stimulating the growth skeletal muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases lipolysis and decreases the entry triglycerides within adequate lipid of the body . 
the somatropine increases serum concentrations ( Insulin-like IGF-1 Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
moreover , the following properties were special . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of liver receptors increases in LDL-cholesterol levels , and change the lipid profile and serum lipoprotéines . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with growth hormone deficiency results in a decrease in LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum . 
a decrease in total cholesterol serum may also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
children with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated by administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the growth hormone deficiency is associated with a decrease in plasma volumes and extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine exhibit a sodium retention , potassium and phosphorique . 
bone metabolism : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents mineral bone and the density in loading sites body increase after long-term administration of somatropine to patients with a growth hormone deficiency and with a ostéopénie . 
exercise capacity : 
the strength muscle and the ability to exercise are améliorées after a long-term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases also heart rate but the mechanism has has 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , strengths of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used until the final size . 
data from the literature suggest an late 0.5 SD in children / adolescents are small for age gestational not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety data is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
elimination The mean terminal a half life of the somatropine is approximately 0.4 hour after administration venous intra- to adults déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope powder and solvent for solution for injection , the half-life reached 3 hours . 
sous-population The absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in patients male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes either this . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data from studies subaiguë toxicity and local tolerance with Omnitrope revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data from other general toxicity studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with the somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
genotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo mutation genetic technology and induction aberrations is were negative with the somatropine . 
it has been observed a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients after long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of this data is not clear . 
in another study , it has not been differences chromosomal gullet in lymphocytes patients who had been treated with the long-term somatropine .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : thyroid of the antéhypophyse and analogues . 
ATC code : 
the somatropine is a potent metabolic hormone signals important in the metabolism lipids , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with growth hormone deficiency . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing the retention azotée , in stimulating the growth skeletal muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases serum concentrations ( Insulin-like IGF-1 Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
moreover , the following properties were special . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of liver receptors increases in LDL-cholesterol levels , and change the lipid profile and serum lipoprotéines . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with growth hormone deficiency results in a decrease in LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum . 
a decrease in total cholesterol serum may also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
children with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated by administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the growth hormone deficiency is associated with a decrease in plasma volumes and extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine exhibit a sodium retention , potassium and phosphorique . 
bone metabolism : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents mineral bone and the density in loading sites body increase after long-term administration of somatropine to patients with a growth hormone deficiency and with a ostéopénie . 
18 Forced physical : 
the strength muscle and the ability to exercise are améliorées after a long-term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases also heart rate , but the mechanism has not been elucidated . 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , strengths of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used until the final size . 
data from the literature suggest an late 0.5 SD in children / adolescents are small for age gestational not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety data is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
elimination The mean half-life terminal of the somatropine is approximately 0.4 hour after administration venous intra- to adults déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope , the half-life reached 3 hours . 
sous-population The absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in the in patients male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes either this . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data from studies subaiguë toxicity and local tolerance with Omnitrope revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data from other general toxicity studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with the somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
genotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo mutation genetic technology and induction aberrations is were negative with the somatropine . 
it has been observed a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients after long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of this data is not clear . 
in another study , it has not been differences chromosomal gullet in lymphocytes patients who had been treated with the long-term somatropine .

therapeutic indications 
infants , children and adolescents 
- Retard growth consistent with a deficiency somatotrope 
- Retard growth bound to a syndrome of Turner 
- Retard growth associated with chronic renal failure . 
- Retard growth ( height current &lt; - 2.5 SDS ( score standard déviation ) and size parentale 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by genetic test appropriate . 
adults 
- Treatment replacement therapy in adults with severe somatotrope deficiency . 
patients with severe somatotrope acquis deficiency in adulthood are defined as a condition known hypothalamo-hypophysaire and at least one other hormone deficiency adenoma , except the prolactine . 
a single dynamic test should be performed to diagnostiquer or exclude growth hormone deficiency in these patients . 
the limits of dynamiques testing should only be swallowed defined . 
posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
22 The dose and schedule of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were used . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
paediatric patients including the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year and including épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
growth retardation in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses may be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is required after 6 months of treatment ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 SD .

growth hormone deficiency in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose , 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually in the needs of the patient , determined by the rate of IGF-1 yielding concentrations of IGF-1 , on the basis of age not above the upper 2 SD . 
patients with the rise in IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should receive the growth hormone up to achieve an rate of IGF-1 higher in the range of normal , without exceed 2 SD . 
the clinical response well as the side effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1.0 mg per day . 
women may need of doses higher than men ; men with increased sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with substitution therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens , are sous-dosées whereas men are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the somatotrope hormone should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
23 THE injection should be subcutaneous and it is necessary to rotate the injection sites to avoid the onset of lipoatrophies . 
instructions for use and handling : see section 6.6 . 
Contre-indications 
- Hypersensitivity to the somatropine or any of the excipients . 
- The somatropine should not be used in case of tumour and activity any treatment 
antitumour should be completed before instituting therapy . 
- The somatropine should not be used to support the growth of patients whose 
- The patients with a critique acute have complications being secondary to a 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine can cause resistance as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes could be established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , may be allowed to affect the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , increased the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and serum concentrations in T3 . 
usually , peripheral levels of thyroid hormones remain in the reference normes healthy subjects . 
the effects of somatropine on the rate of thyroid hormones may have a clinical consequences in patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique middle in which a anticipating metabolic hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , a hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is therefore particularly recommended control thyroid function after vena treatment with the somatropine and after dosage . 
decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this reduction may be related to the changes transport proteins or to increased hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of deficiency somatotrope secondary to treatment together , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients who have problems with their endocriniens , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of headache severe , or , visual , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of eye for a possible oedema papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if there is occurs , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
24 recommend the continued treatment with growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
however , the clinical experience showed that the réintroduction treatment was often possible without récurrence intracranial of hypertension . 
if treatment with the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of symptoms hypertension intracranial is necessary . 
in patients aged over 60 years , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome , treatment should always be associated with a energy-restricted diet . 
patients experiencing SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with a Prader- syndrome , a Willi titration signs of airway obstruction , of subjective apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of airway obstruction , the problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea of subjective should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with consider reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during night monitored , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of airway obstruction ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea of subjective is suspected . 
all patients had a Prader-Willi syndrome should be monitored for signs of infections Respiratory , which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated effectively . 
all patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi should also be pondéral control before and during treatment with the growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome . 
in all children , the scoliose can develop in a growth regular . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of scoliose during treatment with the growth hormone . 
experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before instituting therapy then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a hyperglycaemia been test orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical develops , the growth hormone should not be administered . 
25 In children / adolescents are small for age gestational , it is recommended to measure the levels of IGF-l prior to initiating therapy , and subsequently 2 times per year . 
if on measures , the rate of IGF-l are greater than 2 SD compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , the ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately before puberty in children are small for age gestational is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy immediately before puberty . 
the experience in patients with glucose-galactose Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents are small for age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final size is reached . 
in the case of renal impairment , renal function should be decreased 50 compared to normal . 
prior to initiating therapy , to be confirmed delayed growth , advises growth should be followed in the past during one year before emergency treatment . 
during this period , treatment of renal impairment ( including control acidosis hyperparathyroidism the , and the condition nutritionnel ) should have been initiated and should be held for the duration of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued if kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent patients with chronic renal failure treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
based on the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients with a critique acute benefits of continuing treatment in this situation should be provided as therapy with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a condition acute critique other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine should be provided as therapy with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
due to the presence of benzyl alcohol , this medicinal product must not be given to prématurés nor to patients . 
it may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children less than 3 years . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on results of an interaction study performed in adults with deficiency growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical consequence of this finding is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there are no data on the use of this product in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animals regarding the toxicity of Omnitrope on reproductive are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in pregnancy . 
in a pregnancy normal , the rate of growth hormone adenoma decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the growth hormone placental to approximately 30 weeks . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary for deficiency growth hormone in women for the 3e trimester of pregnancy . 
it is not known if the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
Omnitrope should only be given with caution in women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
undesirable effects 
decrease of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with growth hormone deficiency . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is initiated , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , rigidity coldness , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these side effects are Uncommon severe to moderate , they occur in the first months of therapy and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and age patients ; it can be conversely related to age patients in the onset of growth hormone deficiency . 
in paediatric patients , such side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leukaemias have been reported in paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency appears similar to those in children with no growth hormone deficiency . 
immune system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine resulted to antibody formation in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low and their formation is evidence of no clinical evidence .

mg / kg body weight mg / m2 of body surface area Indication Déficit in growth hormone Stevens-Johnson syndrome Prader-Willi Stevens-Johnson syndrome Turner Renal insufficiency chronic Children / adolescents are small for age 
0.025 to 0.035 0.035 0,045 to 0.050 0,045 to 0.050 
0.7 to 1.0 1.0 1.4 1.4 
growth hormone deficiency in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose , 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually in the needs of the patient , determined by the rate of IGF-1 yielding concentrations of IGF-1 , on the basis of age not above the upper 2 SD . 
patients with the rise in IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should receive the growth hormone up to achieve an rate of IGF-1 higher in the range of normal , without exceed 2 SD . 
the clinical response well as the side effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1.0 mg per day . 
women may need of doses higher than men ; men with increased sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with substitution therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens , are sous-dosées whereas men are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the somatotrope hormone should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
the injection should be subcutaneous and it is necessary to rotate the injection sites to avoid the onset of lipoatrophies . 
33 &quot; Instructions for use and handling : see section 6.6 . 
Contre-indications 
- Hypersensitivity to the somatropine or any of the excipients . 
- The somatropine should not be used in case of tumour and activity any treatment 
antitumour should be completed before instituting therapy . 
- The somatropine should not be used to support the growth of patients whose

special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine can cause resistance as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes could be established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , may be allowed to affect the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , increased the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and serum concentrations in T3 . 
usually , peripheral levels of thyroid hormones remain in the reference normes healthy subjects . 
the effects of somatropine on the rate of thyroid hormones may have a clinical consequences in patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique middle in which a anticipating metabolic hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , a hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is therefore particularly recommended control thyroid function after vena treatment with the somatropine and after dosage . 
decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this reduction may be related to the changes transport proteins or to increased hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of deficiency somatotrope secondary to treatment together , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients who have problems with their endocriniens , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of headache severe , or , visual , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of eye for a possible oedema papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if there is occurs , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
the present time is not recommend the continued treatment with growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
if treatment 
34 by the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of symptoms hypertension intracranial is necessary . 
in patients aged over 60 years , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome , treatment should always be associated with a energy-restricted diet . 
patients experiencing SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with a Prader- syndrome , a Willi titration signs of airway obstruction , of subjective apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of airway obstruction , the problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea of subjective should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with consider reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during night monitored , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of airway obstruction ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea of subjective is suspected . 
all patients had a Prader-Willi syndrome should be monitored for signs of infections Respiratory , which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated effectively . 
all patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi should also be pondéral control before and during treatment with the growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome . 
in all children , the scoliose can develop in a growth regular . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of scoliose during treatment with the growth hormone . 
experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with glucose-galactose Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before instituting therapy then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a hyperglycaemia been test orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical develops , the growth hormone should not be administered . 
if on of repeated measures levels 
35 of IGF-l are greater than 2 SD compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , the ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately before puberty in children are small for age gestational is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy immediately before puberty . 
the experience in patients with glucose-galactose Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents are small for age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final size is reached . 
in the case of renal impairment , renal function should be decreased 50 compared to normal . 
prior to initiating therapy , to be confirmed delayed growth , advises growth should be followed in the past during one year before emergency treatment . 
during this period , treatment of renal impairment ( including control acidosis hyperparathyroidism the , and the condition nutritionnel ) should have been initiated and should be held for the duration of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued if kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent patients with chronic renal failure treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
based on the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients with a critique acute benefits of continuing treatment with somatropinedans this situation should be provided as therapy with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a condition acute critique other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine should be provided as therapy with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on results of an interaction study performed in adults with deficiency growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds by the cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical consequence of this finding is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there are no data on the use of this product in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animals regarding the toxicity of Omnitrope on reproductive are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in pregnancy . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine 
36 should not be necessary for deficiency growth hormone in women for the 3e trimester of pregnancy . 
it is not known if the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
Omnitrope should only be given with caution in women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed . 
undesirable effects 
decrease of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with growth hormone deficiency . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is initiated , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , rigidity coldness , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these side effects are Uncommon severe to moderate , they occur in the first months of therapy and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and age patients ; it can be conversely related to age patients in the onset of growth hormone deficiency . 
in paediatric patients , such side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leukaemias have been reported in paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency appears similar to those in children with no growth hormone deficiency . 
immune system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine resulted to antibody formation in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low and their formation is evidence of no clinical evidence . 
Endocrine disorders 
type 2 diabetes . 
nervous system disorders 
common : 
Uncommon : 
paraesthesia in the adulte. of nasolacrimal carpien syndrome in adults ; paraesthesia in the patient pédiatrique. intracranial bénigne hypertension . 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
common : 
Uncommon : 
extremities rigidity , arthralgia , myalgia in rigidity adulte. extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in paediatric patients . 
37 General disorders and administration site conditions 
common : 
oedema peripheral in adults ; skin reactions localised and injection site passagères in paediatric patients . 
Uncommon : 
oedema peripheral in paediatric patients . 
overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia initially , then secondary to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , long term lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of the excess of growth hormone in humans . 
pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : thyroid of the antéhypophyse and analogues . 
ATC code : 
the somatropine is a potent metabolic hormone signals important in the metabolism lipids , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with growth hormone deficiency . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing the retention azotée , in stimulating the growth skeletal muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases lipolysis and decreases the entry triglycerides within adequate lipid of the body . 
the somatropine increases serum concentrations ( Insulin-like IGF-1 Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
moreover , the following properties were special . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of liver receptors increases in LDL-cholesterol levels , and change the lipid profile and serum lipoprotéines . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with growth hormone deficiency results in a decrease in LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum . 
a decrease in total cholesterol serum may also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
children with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated by administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the growth hormone deficiency is associated with a decrease in plasma volumes and extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine exhibit a sodium retention , potassium and phosphorique . 
bone metabolism : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents mineral bone and the density in loading sites body increase after long-term administration of somatropine to patients with a growth hormone deficiency and with a ostéopénie . 
exercise capacity : 
the strength muscle and the ability to exercise are améliorées after a long-term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases also heart rate , but the mechanism did 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , strengths of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used until the final size . 
data from the literature suggest an late 0.5 SD in children / adolescents are small for age gestational not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety data is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption The bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
after subcutaneous administration of a 5 mg dose of Omnitrope from Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection to healthy adult Cmax and tmax values are respectively 74 22 g / l and 3.9 1.2 hours . 
elimination The mean terminal a half life of the somatropine is approximately 0.4 hour after administration venous intra- to adults déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection , the half-life reached 3 hours . 
sous-population The absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in the in patients male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes either this . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data from studies subaiguë toxicity and local tolerance with Omnitrope revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data from other general toxicity studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with the somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
genotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo mutation genetic technology and induction aberrations is were negative with the somatropine . 
it has been observed a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients after long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of this data is not clear . 
in another study , it has not been differences chromosomal gullet in lymphocytes patients who had been treated with the long-term somatropine .

what OMNITROPE IS EC as amended IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Omnitrope is growth hormone human made by a method known as recombinant DNA technology from a strain of E. coli . 
the structure is identical produced by the human body . 
Omnitrope 1.3 mg / ml is only for single use only . 
Omnitrope is used in the following 
treatment of infants , children and adolescents : 
- with growth retardation consistent with a deficiency of production of growth hormone . 
- with growth retardation bound to a syndrome of Turner . 
- with growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) . 
- with growth retardation in children / adolescents are small for age gestational , 
has not rattrapé their retardation growth to age of 4 years of age or older . 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by genetic test appropriate . replacement therapy with the growth hormone in adults with confirmed deficiency and pronounced in growth hormone in the enfance or in adulthood . 
before YOU TAKE OMNITROPE 
the diagnosis and treatment with Omnitrope should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
do not use Omnitrope 
- If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to somatropine or to any of the other ingredients

what Onsenal ? 
Onsenal is a medicine that contains the active substance célécoxib . 
it is available as white capsules ( 200 and 400 mg ) . 
what is Onsenal used ? 
Onsenal is used to reduce the number of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . 
it is characterised by genetic disease polyps adénomateux mouth , excroissances which develop from the lining of the colon or rectum . 
therefore , the 20 November 2001 , Onsenal was designated an orphan medicine &apos; ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how is Onsenal used ? 
the recommended dose of Onsenal is 400 mg twice daily , during a meal . 
management prescription usual patients with FAP should be continued . 
in patients with moderate liver disease , the dose of Onsenal should be reduced by half and Onsenal should be used with caution in patients who have problems with mild to moderate kidney function . 
Onsenal should not be administered to patients who have severe kidney or liver . 
it should be used with caution , possibly with an initial dose lower , in patients with the body assimile Onsenal slowly . 
special precaution should be exercised when of its use in the elderly . 
the maximum recommended daily dose of Onsenal is 800 mg . 
how Onsenal to work ? 
the active substance of Onsenal , the célécoxib , is an anti-inflammatory non-stéroïdien ( NSAIDs ) , which belongs to the group monoamine cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
the célécoxib blocks the enzyme COX-2 , which has for effect a reduction of the production of prostaglandins , substances that 
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. activities in process such as inflammation and the activity of the side muscle ( muscle which effectue tasks automatiques as opening and closure of the blood vessels ) . 
how has Onsenal been studied ? 
Onsenal has been studied in one main study involving on 83 adults with FAP , in whom the effectiveness of two doses of Onsenal was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) . 
in the study , 25 patients had a colon ( lower intestine ) intact , but other had undergone tumour of the entire part or the colon . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of polyps in a area defined the anterior the colon or rectum after six months of treatment . 
an additional study was reproduction on the effects of Onsenal in 18 children with FAP . 
what benefit by Onsenal shown during the studies ? 
Onsenal , at a dose of 400 mg twice daily was more effective than placebo . 
in adults , Onsenal was reduce the number mean polyps 28 after six months , whereas their number had decreased 5 in placebo-treated patients . 
Onsenal was also reduces the number of polyps in children with FAP . 
what is the risk associated with Onsenal ? 
the most common side effects reported with Onsenal ( in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and diarrhoea . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with Onsenal , see the Package Leaflet . 
Onsenal should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to célécoxib , any of the other ingredients , or sulphonamides ( such as certain antibiotic ) . 
Onsenal should not be prescribed to pregnant women or to become pregnant in the absence of contraception nor to women . 
it should not be administered to patients with severe liver disease or , to patients with kidney disease causing inflammation of the gut or for patients with some problems affecting the heart or the blood vessels . 
for a full list of restrictions , see the Package Leaflet . 
why has Onsenal been approved ? 
the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Onsenal &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for the reduction in the number of polyps mouth adénomateux in patients with FAP in supplements and surgery monitoring endoscopique . 
the Committee noted that no effect of a decreased number of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of developing cancer intestines has been demonstrated . 
the Committee recommended that be given marketing authorisation for Onsenal . 
Onsenal has been authorised under Exceptional Circumstances . 
this means that because of the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information about Onsenal . 
every year , the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) will review any new information that may become available and , if appropriate , will carry out the updated present summary . 
what information is still awaited for Onsenal ? 
the company that makes Onsenal will keep a study in patients with FAP to recueillir more information on the safety and effectiveness of the medicine .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , in combination with surgery and addition of monitoring endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of the reduction in the number and size Onsenal polyps induced on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is two capsules 200 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in these patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment limited , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications , 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
paediatric population : 
2 Métaboliseurs metabolisers CYP2C9 : 
patients poor metabolisers CYP2C9 or suspectés be on the basis of génotype or history / experience with other substrates CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution because the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis has not been established . 
special precautions for may be necessary in these patients ( see section pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
Contre-indications 
- Maladie inflammatory intestine . 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis with the célécoxib has been studied up to 6 months and did not show decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or another form of cancer or reduction in the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of monitoring endoscopique replacement should not be reduced and surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis should not be delayed . 
gastrointestinal disorders Post-marketing high , gastrointestinal complications &#91; perforations , ulcers or haemorrhage ( PUH ) &#93; , some with fatal outcome have been observed in patients treated with célécoxib . 
there is potentiation the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
3 Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis with anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive of concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after an in-depth evaluation ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
because of their lack of antiplatelet effects , the COX-2 selective inhibitors cannot cannot be substituted to acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases thromboembolic . 
therefore , agents anti-agrégants inhibitors should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics or in volume depletion . 
like all NSAIDs , the célécoxib may cause Activity-neutralizing hypertension or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , blood pressure should be closely monitored upon initiation of therapy with célécoxib and any during treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , particular attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the imbalance impaired , renal or hepatic function and particularly of cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical supervision should be established . 
renal and hepatic impairment The NSAIDs , including the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
clinical studies performed with the célécoxib showed renal effects similar to those observed with NSAIDs comparator . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , a Cancer impaired hepatic and elderly patients . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 Posology and method of administration and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
4 Post-marketing appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration Cancer of organs treatment mentioned during treatment . 
the risk of these effects appears to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in most cases during the first month of treatment . 
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 Undesirable effects ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued the first sign of skin rash , mucosal mucous membranes or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Patients known to be of poor metabolisers CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin , haemorrhage serious were reported . 
caution should be taken in case of combination of célécoxib with warfarin or other anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules of Onsenal 200 mg contain lactose ( 49,8 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , a LAPP lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction The majority interaction studies have been performed with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg twice daily ( such as those used in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice daily cannot be excluded . 
anti-clotting activity should be controlled in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , in particular the days following the initiation or change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , the dose of oral anticoagulants should be accompanied by close of prothrombin time INR patients . 
NSAIDs may reduce the effects of diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs medicines . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , then necessary pioglitazone undergo periodic . 
an increase in blood nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked in case of concomitant NSAIDs with the derivatives ciclosporin D or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored when combination of célécoxib with any of these medicines . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but cannot cannot be substituted to acetylsalicylic acid in the cardiovascular prevention . 
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
pharmacokinetic interactions 
effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products The célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate CYP2D6 , increased of 136 . 
plasma concentrations of substrates medicines this enzyme may be increased in combination with the célécoxib . 
the medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 are , for example , tricyclic antidepressants ( and inhibitors selective serotonin reuptake ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of CYP2D6 substrates with the dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if needed at the start of therapy or célécoxib increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies demonstrate that the célécoxib was anticipated to inhibit the cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is not known . 
the medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , the citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl estradiol ) . 
the célécoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or glyburide in clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , the célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters ( plasma clearance or kidney ) methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of toxicity related at methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
in healthy subjects , concomitant administration of 200 mg twice daily , célécoxib with 450 mg twice daily lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 Cmax and 18 AUC lithium . 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be monitored closely when introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
6 In subjects who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and who have increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due of exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 , it should be used to half of the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg célécoxib and 200 mg once a day , fluconazole , potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean Cmax 60 and AUC of 130 of célécoxib . 
concomitant use with of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction toxicity ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and 5.3 Preclinical safety data ) . 
the potential risk for the Use is unknown . 
like other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , the célécoxib may lead to inertie utérine and closure prématurée of nasolacrimal artériel during the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding pregnancy during treatment , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma . 
administration of célécoxib to a limited number of women who are breast-feeding showed a very low levels of leakage of célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
it studies have not been performed to determine the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
undesirable effects 
undesirable effects are listed by system organ class and classified by frequency in Table 1 , on the basis of following sources data : 
- The adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as comparator NSAIDs beta- blocking agents , approximately 7400 arthritiques patients were treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
the side effects reported with the célécoxib in these additional studies were consistent with biochemical marker evidence those occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and arthrose Table 1 . 
- The adverse reactions reported spontaneously after the Holder , period during 
how long it is estimated to more 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and instructions ) . 
whenever where all side effects are not reported in MAH and included in the database , it is difficult provide way reliable the frequency of these side effects .

pharmacological PROPERTIES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : 
antinéoplasiques , ATC code : 
the célécoxib is a derivative of pyrazole substitué by two groupements aryl , chemical analogue other sulphonamides non-arylaminiques ( e. g. thiazides , furosémide ) but differently of sulphonamides arylaminiques ( e. g. sulfamethoxazole and other antibiotics sulphonamides ) . 
the célécoxib lyophilisate , is a selective inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
no inhibition statistically significant COX-1 ( investigated inhibition ex-vivo the formation of thromboxane B2 &#91; TxB2 &#93; ) was observed in healthy volunteers to the therapeutic dose , familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , 400 mg twice daily . 
the cyclo-oxygénase is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins . 
two isoforms , COX-1 and COX-2 , have been identified . 
the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) is the predominant enzyme of induced a stimulus cytokines and is supposée be the major responsible for the synthesis prostanoïdes mediators of pain , inflammation and fever . 
high levels of COX-2 is recovered in there pré-malignes lesions ( such as polyps adénomateux colorectaux ) and cancers épithéliaux . 
the familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is a disease genetic from alteration genetic autosomale dominante of a gene suppresseur of tumour , gene APC ( Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ) . 
the polyps with of gene mutation APC and not treated surexprimant the COX-2 , continue of form and develop in the colon or rectum with a risk of progression to colorectal cancer 100 . 
the COX-2 is also involved in ovulation , implantation and closure of nasolacrimal artériel , the régulation kidney function and some central nervous system functions ( fever induction , pain perception and cognitive function ) . 
it may also play an in the risk of ulcers . 
the COX-2 has been found in the of tissue around gastric ulcers in man but its implication in the risk of ulcers has not been established . 
the difference antiplaquettaire activity between some NSAIDs monoamine COX-1 and COX-2 selective inhibitors may have a the clinical significance in patients at risk of thromboembolic reactions . 
COX-2 inhibitors reduce the formation of systemic prostacycline ( and therefore possibly endothelial ) , without compromise the platelet thromboxane . 
dose- effect on the formation of TxB2 was observed after high doses of célécoxib . 
however , in healthy subjects and in studies low effectif , multiple-dose with 600 mg twice daily , the célécoxib had no effect on platelet aggregation , nor on the time of bleeding compared to placebo . 
inhibition of the COX-2 can affect viability of the tumour without relationship inflammation . 
the célécoxib inhibits the formation of tumours in the cancer preclinical models of the colon , which surexpriment the COX-2 , induites chimiquement ( the model rat AOM ) or mutation genetic ( the model mouse MIN ) . 
it has been shown to reduce the number and the célécoxib the size of polyps adénomateux colorectaux . 
a study controlled , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , has been performed in 83 patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis . 
the study population consisted of 58 patients who have had previously a partial or colectomie total and 25 patients had a colon intact . 
thirteen subjects had a atténué phenotype for the familial adenomatous polyposis . 
a significant reduction of the surface adenomatous duodénale has also been observed compared to placebo ( 14,5 with the célécoxib 400 mg twice daily versus 1.4 with placebo ) , which however was not statistically significant . 
results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of polyps in all treatment groups compared to the célécoxib groups correspondants treated with the placebo . 
the reduction the greater was observed in patients treated with the célécoxib at a dose of 16 mg / kg / day , which corresponds to the recommended dose of 800 mg daily in adults with FAP . 
the safety data have been examined in list by a Committee for independent monitoring who conclu that the dose of célécoxib of 16 mg / kg / day was a dose safely to recommend for futures studies in adolescents with FAP . 
cardiovascular safety long-term studies involving subjects with of polyps adénomateux sporadiques : 
two studies in healthy subjects with of polyps adénomateux sporadiques were conducted with the célécoxib , the trial APC ( prevention of adénome by the célécoxib ) and the trial PreSAP ( prevention of polyps adénomateux spontaneous ) . 
the trial APC has shown a dose-dependent increase of composite ( expertisé ) combining death cardiovascular , myocardial infarction and stroke with the célécoxib compared to placebo during 3 years of treatment . 
the trial PreSAP did not show any statistically significant increase the risk to the same composite . 
combined levels for this composite on 3 years were respectively 3.0 ( 20 cases / 671 subjects ) and 2.5 ( 17 cases / 685 subjects ) , against 0.9 ( 6 cases / 679 subjects ) for placebo . 
increases observed in both groups célécoxib and placebo if expliquent primarily by an increased incidence of myocardial infarction . 
in the clinical trial PreSAP the relative risk compared to placebo for this same composite ( expertisé ) was 1.2 ( 95 CI 0.6 2.4 ) with a 400 mg daily célécoxib compared to placebo . 
combined levels for this composite on 3 years were 2.3 ( 21 cases / 933 subjects ) and 1.9 ( 12 cases / 628 subjects ) . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction ( expertisé ) was 1.0 ( 9 subjects / 933 ) with a 400 mg daily célécoxib , against 0.6 ( 4 cases / 628 subjects ) with placebo . 
data from a third study long-term called ADAPT ( The Alzheimer&apos; Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial ) have not revealed no significant increase of cardiovascular risk associated with taking twice-daily 200 mg célécoxib compared to placebo . 
the relative risk compared to placebo for a composite similar ( death of source CV , MI , stroke ) was 1,14 ( 95 CI 0.61 2.12 ) with a taking twice-daily 200 mg célécoxib . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction was 1.1 ( 8 cases / 717 patients ) with a taking twice-daily 200 mg célécoxib , against 1.2 ( 13 cases / 1070 patients ) with placebo . 
data from pooled tests randomised controlled trials suggest also that the cardiovascular risk may be associated with the use of célécoxib compared to placebo , indicating differences of the risk of the dose of célécoxib .

pharmacokinetic properties 
the célécoxib is well absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations are attained within 2 to 3 hours approximately . 
the taken with food ( high fat meal ) delays the absorption of approximately 1 hour with an increase of absorption ( AUC ) of 10 to 20 . 
the célécoxib is primarily eliminated by metabolism . 
less than 1 of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine . 
variability of inter-sujets célécoxib exposure is approximately a 10-fold . 
at therapeutic doses , the pharmacokinetic profile célécoxib has a independent time and dose . 
plasma protein binding is approximately 97 to therapeutic plasma concentrations , and the célécoxib is not préférentiellement bound erythrocytes . 
the half-life of elimination is 8 to 12 hours . 
steady state plasma concentrations are reached in less than 5 days of treatment . 
the pharmacological activity is attributed to the parent substance . 
main human metabolites present in the circulation did not activity décelable on the COX-1 or COX-2 . 
the metabolism of célécoxib is mainly bound to cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 . 
three metabolites inhibitors inactive as COX-1 and COX-2 , have been identified in human plasma , a alcohol primary , carboxylique corresponding and its glucuronide conjugate . 
activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 is reduced for people with a polymorphisme genetic with for effect of reduce enzymatic activity , as of variantes homozygous of polymorphisme CYP2C9 3 . 
in three studies were conducted in distinctes 5 subjects of génotype CYP2C9 3 / 3 , AUC 0-24 of a single dose was increased by 3 times approximately compared to normal CYP2D6 . 
it is estimated to 0.3 to 1.0 the frequency of génotype 3 / 3 homozygote among different groups ethniques . 
patients poor metabolisers CYP2C9 or suspectés be on the basis of history / experience with other substrates CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution ( see section 4.2 ) . 
it has not been differences clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of célécoxib between the populations afro-américaine and Caucasian . 
when a dose of 200 mg per day is given values gave in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were respectively 41 and 146 . 
in patients with impaired mild to moderate , the metabolic capacity was well related to their levels of serum albumin . 
in patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25-35 g / l ) , the daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 . 
patients with severe hepatic impairment ( serum albumin &lt; 25g / l ) have not been studied , the célécoxib is contraindicated in this type of patients . 
13 The pharmacokinetics of célécoxib has not been studied in patients with renal impairment but should not be affected influence in these patients because that it is extensively metabolised by the liver . 
there are limited data on the use of célécoxib in renal impairment and therefore , caution is recommended when treating patients with renal impairment . 
severe renal impairment is contraindication . 
preclinical safety data 
of hernies diaphragmatiques were also seen in a study of toxicity and péri- the natale in rats , which included a exposure to product during the period of organogenèse . 
in this last study , the lower systemic exposure for this abnormal occurred in one animal the relative range safety was estimated 2 times the recommended daily dose in humans ( 800 mg ) . 
in animals , exposure to célécoxib during the early stages of embryonal / caused of pre- loss and the implantatoires . 
these effects are to be related to the following inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of rats . 
in a study of péri- and the natalité in rats , toxicity was observed in the offspring . 
in a study of toxicity two years , an increase of thrombosis not surrénaliennes was observed at high doses in rats male .

clinical PARTICULARS 
therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , in combination with surgery and addition of monitoring endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of the reduction in the number and size Onsenal polyps induced on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is one capsule of 400 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in these patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment limited , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications , 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
paediatric population : 
16 Métaboliseurs metabolisers CYP2C9 : 
patients poor metabolisers CYP2C9 or suspectés be on the basis of génotype or history / experience with other substrates CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution because the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis has not been established . 
special precautions for may be necessary in these patients ( see section pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
Contre-indications 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis with the célécoxib has been studied up to 6 months and did not show decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or another form of cancer or reduction in the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of monitoring endoscopique replacement should not be reduced and surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis should not be delayed . 
there is potentiation the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
significant differences in the safety gastrointestinal between the combination of the COX-2 selective inhibitors / acetylsalicylic acid and combination NSAIDs / acetylsalicylic acid has not been demonstrated in clinical trials long-term ( see section 5.1 ) . 
17 THE combination of célécoxib and an NSAID other than aspirin should be avoided . 
patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis with anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive of concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after an in-depth evaluation ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
due to their absence of effects inhibitors , the COX-2 selective inhibitors cannot cannot be substituted to acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases thromboembolic . 
therefore , agents anti-agrégant inhibitors should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics or in volume depletion . 
like all NSAIDs , the célécoxib may cause Activity-neutralizing hypertension or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , blood pressure should be closely monitored upon initiation of therapy with célécoxib and any during treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , particular attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the imbalance impaired , renal or hepatic function and particularly of cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical supervision should be established . 
renal and hepatic impairment The NSAIDs , including the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
clinical studies performed with the célécoxib showed renal effects similar to those observed with NSAIDs comparator . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , a Cancer impaired hepatic and elderly patients . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
18 THE experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
of appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration Cancer a of organs treatment mentioned during treatment . 
skin reactions Post-marketing serious skin reactions , some fatal outcome , as the dermatitis exfoliative , Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( toxic epidermal necrolysis ) , have been reported very rarely in combination with the use of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the risk of these effects appears to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in most cases during the first month of treatment . 
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and angioedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued the first sign of skin rash , mucosal mucous membranes or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Patients known to be of poor metabolisers CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section pharmacokinetic properties ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin serious haemorrhage have been reported . 
caution should be exercised when concomitant administration of célécoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules of Onsenal 400 mg contain lactose ( 99,6 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , a LAPP lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction The majority interaction studies have been performed with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg twice daily ( such as those used in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice daily cannot be excluded . 
anti-clotting activity should be controlled in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , in particular the days following the initiation or change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , the dose of oral anticoagulants should be accompanied by close of prothrombin time INR patients . 
19 The NSAIDs may reduce the effects of diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs medicines . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , then necessary pioglitazone undergo periodic . 
an increase in blood nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked in case of concomitant NSAIDs with the derivatives ciclosporin D or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored when combination of célécoxib with any of these medicines . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but cannot cannot be substituted to acetylsalicylic acid in the cardiovascular prevention . 
( see section 5.1 Pharmacodynamics ) . 
pharmacokinetic interactions 
effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products The célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate CYP2D6 , increased of 136 . 
plasma concentrations of substrates medicines this enzyme may be increased in combination with the célécoxib . 
the medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6 are , for example , tricyclic antidepressants ( and inhibitors selective serotonin reuptake ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of CYP2D6 substrates with the dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if needed at the start of therapy or célécoxib increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies demonstrate that the célécoxib was anticipated to inhibit the cytochrome P 450 catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is not known . 
the medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , the citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl estradiol ) . 
the célécoxib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or glyburide in clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , the célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters ( plasma clearance or kidney ) methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of toxicity related at methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
20 In healthy subjects , concomitant administration of 200 mg twice daily , célécoxib with 450 mg twice daily lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 Cmax and 18 AUC lithium . 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be monitored closely when introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
in subjects who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and who have increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due of exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 , it should be used to half of the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg célécoxib and 200 mg once a day , fluconazole , potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean Cmax 60 and AUC of 130 of célécoxib . 
concomitant use with of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction toxicity ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and 5.3 Preclinical safety data ) . 
the potential risk for the Use is unknown . 
like other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , the célécoxib may lead to inertie utérine and closure prématurée of nasolacrimal artériel during the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding pregnancy during treatment , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in plasma . 
administration of célécoxib to a limited number of women who are breast-feeding showed a very low levels of leakage of célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
it studies have not been performed to determine the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
undesirable effects are listed by system organ class and classified by frequency in Table 1 , on the basis of following sources data : 
- The adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as comparator NSAIDs beta- blocking agents , approximately 7400 arthritiques patients were treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
- The adverse reactions reported spontaneously after the Holder , period during 
how long it is estimated to more 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and instructions ) . 
whenever where all side effects are not reported in MAH and included in the database , it is difficult provide way reliable the frequency of these side effects .
