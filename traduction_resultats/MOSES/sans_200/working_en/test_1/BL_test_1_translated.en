clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
6 patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
studies have shown that coadministration of these two medicinal products do 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne .

pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is compound folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced by cells cho ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the effect the larger from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe in fsh deficiency and lh were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should consider the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of the lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , initiates the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
9 volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is approximately 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with a hazard ratio of accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f has however shown its ability to stimulate development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh not measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already listed in other sections of this spc . 
a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate development folliculaire in women who have severe deficiency in lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent joint . 
to avoid the injection of volumes too intervals , it may dissolve up to 3 ampoules or vials of powder in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 iu or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu up to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after beginning treatment with a , both therapies is continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
13 experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 iu or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended that do not use gonal-f when response effective do may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy 
14 in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 iu or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
15 high of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
16 patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
studies have shown that coadministration of these two medicinal products do

use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne .

a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate development folliculaire in women who have severe deficiency in lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
22 gonal-f if administered subcutaneously . 
the powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent joint . 
to avoid the injection of volumes too intervals , it may dissolve up to 3 vials of powder in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu up to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks 
23 of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended that do not use gonal-f when response effective do may not be achieved , for example : in women : 
24 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
25 ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
26 in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
27 clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied .

the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of hyperstimulation syndrome ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is compound folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced by cells cho ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the effect the larger from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe in fsh deficiency and lh were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should consider the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of the lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , initiates the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is approximately 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with a hazard ratio of accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f has however shown its ability to stimulate development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh not measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already listed in other sections of this spc . 
a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended that do not use gonal-f when response effective do may not be achieved , for example : in women : 
35 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
36 ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
37 in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
38 clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of hyperstimulation syndrome ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is compound folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced by cells cho ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the effect the larger from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe in fsh deficiency and lh were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should consider the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of the lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , initiates the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is approximately 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with a hazard ratio of accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f has however shown its ability to stimulate development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh not measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already listed in other sections of this spc . 
a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent joint . 
43 37,5 iu ( 2.8 micrograms ) may be dissolved in 1 ml solvent and mixed with gonal-f 75 iu ( 5.5 micrograms ) and / or gonal-f 150 iu ( 11 micrograms ) . 
up to 3 vials of powder can be dissolved in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu up to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks 
44 of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended that do not use gonal-f when response effective do may not be achieved , for example : in women : 
45 renal ovarienne packaging malformation of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
46 ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
47 in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
48 clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate development folliculaire in women who have severe deficiency in lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
53 gonal-f if administered subcutaneously . 
before the first use , the powder should be reconstituted with the solvent joint . 
gonal-f 1.050 iu / 1.75 ml ( 77 micrograms / 1.75 ml ) should not be reconstituted with other ampoules / vials of gonal-f . 
the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu up to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks 
54 of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended that do not use gonal-f when response effective do may not be achieved , for example : in women : 
55 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients to injecting yourself , caution should be paid specific instructions for use of multidose presentation . 
gonal-f is which makes making several injections , instructions unclear patients should be provided to avoid poor use of this multidose presentation . 
due to possible local reactions at the benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used several consecutive days . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
56 no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
57 pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
58 population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
gonal-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate development folliculaire in women who have severe deficiency in lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
before the first use , the powder should be reconstituted with the solvent joint . 
gonal-f 450 iu / 0.75 ml ( 33 micrograms / 0.75 ml ) should not be reconstituted with other ampoules / vials of gonal-f . 
the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu up to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after beginning treatment with a , both therapies is continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
65 experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended that do not use gonal-f when response effective do may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy 
66 in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients to injecting yourself , caution should be paid specific instructions for use of multidose presentation . 
gonal-f is which makes making several injections , instructions unclear patients should be provided to avoid poor use of this multidose presentation . 
due to possible local reactions at the benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used several consecutive days . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
67 suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
68 compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
gonal-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of hyperstimulation syndrome ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is compound folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced by cells cho ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the effect the larger from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe in fsh deficiency and lh were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should consider the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of the lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , initiates the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is approximately 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with a hazard ratio of accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f has however shown its ability to stimulate development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh not measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already listed in other sections of this spc . 
in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with the benzyl alcohol ( 0.9 ) or benzyl alcohol alone ( 0.9 ) caused a mild and inflammation haemorrhage subaiguë after subcutaneous injection single and changes moderate type inflammatory or dégénératives after single intramuscular injection . 
a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients to injecting yourself , caution should be paid specific instructions for use of multidose presentation . 
gonal-f is which makes making several injections , instructions unclear patients should be provided to avoid poor use of this multidose presentation . 
due to possible local reactions at the benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used several consecutive days . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
78 suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
79 compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the start of treatment in order to evaluate the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
gonal-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of hyperstimulation syndrome ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is compound folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced by cells cho ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the effect the larger from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe in fsh deficiency and lh were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should consider the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of the lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , initiates the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is approximately 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with a hazard ratio of accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f has however shown its ability to stimulate development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh not measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already listed in other sections of this spc . 
in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with the benzyl alcohol ( 0.9 ) or benzyl alcohol alone ( 0.9 ) caused a mild and inflammation haemorrhage subaiguë after subcutaneous injection single and changes moderate type inflammatory or dégénératives after single intramuscular injection . 
a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate development folliculaire in women who have severe deficiency in lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
86 the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a or the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after beginning treatment with a , both therapies is continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
87 experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response do may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients to injecting yourself , caution should be paid specific instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
90 patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after starting treatment , as part of the response . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is compound folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced by cells cho ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the effect the larger from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe in fsh deficiency and lh were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should consider the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of the lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , initiates the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , the follitropine alfa is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of follitropine alfa administered is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is approximately 70 . 
after repeated administration of follitropine alfa , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with a hazard ratio of accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , the follitropine alfa have however shown its ability to stimulate development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh not measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already listed in other sections of this spc . 
a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate development folliculaire in women who have severe deficiency in lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
96 the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a or the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after beginning treatment with a , both therapies is continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
97 experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response do may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients to injecting yourself , caution should be paid specific instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
the next symptoms may be observed during sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
100 patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after starting treatment , as part of the response . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne .

gonal-f is indicated for stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
106 the recommended doses for gonal-f are consistent with those used with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were used in a study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose necessary lower and duration of treatment shorter , reaching of general pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the rationale with gonal-f is developing alone follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed in injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for response individual each patient , based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve a response adequate but not excessive . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh should , in general , not exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not correct response after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment with a starting dose higher than in enterohepatic abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should resume when cycle following a dosage lower than that cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain a growth folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques assistance prescription to the procreation : 
the schedule designed to cause a superovulation includes administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is obtained mean towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a a or the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after beginning treatment with a , both therapies is continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the 7 days . 
the dose will be then adjusted depending on the response ovarienne . 
107 experience drawn the fiv shows that in general the treatment success rates remain stable for the first four attempts and gradually decline thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to severe deficiency in lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous of oestrogen secretion , treatment may be started at any time cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for each patient individual response , it is based , but it also measured the height of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the monthly injections of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it recommandera then to the patient to others through sexual ratio the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to an qualitative impairment yellow body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be discontinued and the hcg should not be administered . 
treatment should resume when cycle after , a dosage of fsh lower than that cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu , 3 times per week , concomitantly with hcg , for 4 months minimum . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that it may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response do may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope potent may cause allergic reactions mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the use of effective methods of appropriate monitoring . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires follow-up periodic response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a low response . 
depending on the rationale ( males and females ) , the effective dose the lowest approved should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients to injecting yourself , caution should be paid specific instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose and may therefore be considered as free . 
treatment in women : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications to a pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any particularly on the hypothyroidism and corticosurrénalienne impairment , the hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or regard of amp techniques , may be hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing such events will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in interpreting results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that ovarienne sensitivity to gonal-f increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase of the dose of fsh is necessary , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 or 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical trial prospectif comparing the combination gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
109 high of anabolic sexual and increased exposure of the lungs vascular permeability which may cause a within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
clinical function test may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , severe can accompany sho complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
excessive ovarienne response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a condition potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be followed for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended tests échographiques and measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the amp techniques , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when haemoglobin estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to administer the hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy multipack will be minimisé if there is conforme to the recommended dose of gonal-f , at schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the amp techniques , the draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in pregnancy . 
the more often , the sho occurs after discontinuation of treatment and hormonal reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the occurrence of period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment sho of should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
the multiple pregnancies , particularly of high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a natural family , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is primarily related to the number of embryons transférés , their quality and to the age of the patient . 
110 patients should be aware of the potential hazards pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulation of the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in aseptic of amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women with a history of tubaire disease are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in treatments for infertility . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of génital tract 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received of combinations of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophines influence the risk baseline these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to characteristics parentales ( e. g. age of the mother , of sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may in increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared risks . 
it should however noted that pregnancy by itself showed an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
high levels of endogenous fsh are indicateurs failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients do répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after starting treatment , as part of the response . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products has been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of the hfsh erythropoietins . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of hyperstimulation syndrome ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is compound folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced by cells cho ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the effect the larger from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe in fsh deficiency and lh were defined by a plasma levels of endogenous lh &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should consider the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of the lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f administered concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , initiates the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , the follitropine alfa is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of follitropine alfa administered is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is approximately 70 . 
after repeated administration of follitropine alfa , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with a hazard ratio of accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , the follitropine alfa have however shown its ability to stimulate development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh not measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already listed in other sections of this spc . 
a reached fertility has been reported in rats at doses of follitropine alfa pharmacological ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at high doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetus viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a proportion of dystocies similar to that observed with the hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these data have a low clinical relevance .

it contains parts of the ( flu ) viruses that have been inactivées ( tuées ) . 
the vaccine contains a flu strain called a / vietnam / 1194 / 2004 nibrg-14 ( h5n1 ) . 
this vaccine is the same as prepandrix , which is already authorised in the european union ( eu ) . 
the company that makes prepandrix has agreed that its scientific data can be used for this vaccine . 
the vaccine should be given according to official recommendations . 
the vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how to the vaccine is used for ? 
the vaccine is given by injection into the muscle of the upper arm in two doses , at least three weeks apart . 
how to the vaccine been studied ? prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals is a prepandemic &apos;vaccine . 
it is a type special-glycerin vaccine is intended to protect against a flu strain may cause a future pandemic . 
a flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of flu virus can spread easily from person to person because people have no immunity ( protection ) against it . 
a pandemic can affect most countries and regions around the world . 
health experts pensent that the next flu pandemic may be caused by the h5n1 strain of hiv . 
the vaccine has been developed for apporter protection against this strain become , way to be used before or during a flu pandemic . 
this vaccine contains small fragments of haemagglutinines ( proteins from surface ) of virus h5n1 . 
the virus has any first been inactivated ( killed ) so that it does not disease . 
in a new virus exposure , the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly , which may help the body to protect against the disease caused by this virus . 
before use , the vaccine is prepared in mélangeant a suspension that contains particles of hiv with a émulsion . 
the émulsion résultante is then injected . 
the émulsion contains an adjuvant &apos; ( a compound containing oil ) to bruise healing better response . 
how has vaccine been studied ? 
the effects of the vaccine were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans . 
the main study of the vaccine enrolling 400 adults in health and had to compare the ability of different doses of vaccine , with or without the adjuvant &apos; , to trigger the production of antibodies ( immunogenicity ) . 
the participants received two injections of vaccine containing one of four different doses of haemagglutinine . 
the injections have been performed to 21 days apart . 
the main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies anti-grippe in the blood patients at three find distincts : before vaccination , at day of the second injection ( day 21 ) and 21 days later ( day 42 ) . 
other studies have been conducted to étayer the main study and to demonstrate the safety of the vaccine . 
what benefit shown by the vaccine during the studies ? 
according to criteria laid down by the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) , a prepandemic &apos;vaccine should induce protective levels of antibodies in at least 70 of people for it to be considered suitable . 
the main study showed that the vaccine measured to 3.75 micrograms haemagglutinine with an add-on to produced an antibody response that met these criteria . 
at 21e day after the second injection , 84 people who have received the vaccine had levels of antibodies that would protect against the h5n1 . 
what is the risk associated with the use of the vaccine ? 
for the full list of all side effects reported with the vaccine , see the package leaflet . 
it is advisable see vaccination for people with a brusque opportunity fever . 
why has vaccine been approved ? 
the chmp decided that the benefits of prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for active immunisation against subtype h5n1 of flu virus a. 
the committee recommended that the vaccine be given marketing authorisation . 
other information on vaccine : 
the european commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the european union for prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals to glaxosmithkline biologicals s. a. , on 26 september 2008 .

information from clinical data non-cliniques : 
the ability of the vaccine to induce a against the homologous and heterologous strains of the vaccine has been evaluated in pré-clinique with inoculations of a ( challenge ) in the furet . 
in each experience , four groups six ferrets were immunisés intramuscularly with a vaccine adjuvanté with as03 containing hémagglutinine dérivée of the h5n1 strain / a / vietnam / 1194 / 04 ( nibrg-14 ) . 
doses of 15- 5 - 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms hémagglutinine have been tested in experience of challenge transfusions , and doses of 15- 7,5- 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms hémagglutinine have been tested in experience of heterologous challenge . 
the controls have included a immunisés with the adjuvant &apos; alone , the vaccine non-adjuvanté ( 15 micrograms of ha ) or with saline solution tamponnée phosphate . 
ferrets were vaccinated to j0 and j21 and exposure by route intratrachéale to j49 at a dose létale of h5n1 / a / vietnam / 1194 / 04 or h5n1 / has / indonesia / 5 / 05 showing . 
among those receiving the vaccine adjuvanté , respectively 87 and 96 were applied against the dose létale transfusions or showing . 
the excretion viral at upper respiratory tract was also reduced in animals vaccinated compared to controls , suggesting decrease the risk of viral transmission . 
in the control group ( with and without an add-on to ) , all animals are morts or were euthanasiés when they were moribonds , three to four days after initiation of exposure to the dose létale .

hbvaxpro is a vaccine , available in suspension for injection , in vials and pre-filled syringes . 
it contains some parts of the hepatitis b virus as the active substance . 
hbvaxpro is available in two concentrations ( 10 to 40 micrograms / ml ) . 
what is hbvaxpro used for ? 
hbvaxpro is used for vaccination against hepatitis b people with a risk of exposure to hepatitis b virus , such as assessed on the basis of official recommendations . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how to hbvaxpro used for ? 
a course should include at least three injections of hbvaxpro . 
the recommended dose in children up to age of 15 years is 0.5 ml of the concentration the lower ( 10 micrograms / ml ) for each injection . 
for adults and adolescents aged 16 years and over 1 ml of the concentration the lowest approved is administered to each injection . 
the concentration the higher ( 40 micrograms / ml ) is used in patients who are or will be under dialysis ( undergoing a blood clearance technique ) . 
hbvaxpro is usually given by injection into a muscle of the thigh in infants and young children and shoulder in children , adolescents and adults . 
the schedule of injections depends on the age of the patient , the strength of the immune system response to vaccination and the probability of virus exposure hepatitis b. 
for a full list of comparison administration , see the summary of product characteristics ( also part of the epar ) . 
how to hbvaxpro been studied ? 
hbvaxpro is a vaccine . 
vaccines work by apprenant at immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against a disease . 
hbvaxpro contains small amounts of surface antigens ( proteins from the surface ) of the hepatitis b virus . 
when someone receives the vaccine , the immune system recognises the surface antigens as étrangers and produces antibodies against them . 
the immune system will be then 
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. able to produce antibodies more quickly , when the person will be exposed to naturally virus . 
this helps to protect against infection with hepatitis b virus 
this means that they are fixés on of compounds aluminium to induce a better response . 
hbvaxpro has been developed specifically from a vaccine already used in the european union , to remove the preservative thiomersal , which contains of mercury &apos; . 
a exposure repeated at mercury &apos; from sources as medicinal products and food may lead to its accumulation in the organs . 
this accumulation may be harmful and is a cause of concern . 
how has hbvaxpro been studied ? 
as the active substance used in hbvaxpro was already authorised in the european union , hbvaxpro has not been studied formelles . 
the company has supplied information on the comparison other vaccines with and without thiomersal , including studies involving a vaccine containing the same active substance that hbvaxpro . 
what benefit demonstrated by hbvaxpro during the studies ? 
the results of studies presented have shown that vaccines exempts thiomersal induisaient of protective levels of antibodies against hepatitis b virus similar to those induced by vaccines containing thiomersal at the end of the vaccination schedule . 
among these vaccines figuraient those contenaient the same active substance that hbvaxpro . 
what is the risk associated with the use of hbvaxpro ? 
the side effects seen with hbvaxpro ( in 1 to 10 users in 100 ) are injection site reactions including pain , temporary , erythema ( redness ) and a induration ( durcissement ) .

hbvaxpro should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients . 
it must not be used in people who have high fever . 
as with all vaccines , if hbvaxpro is used in grands prématurés , there is a risk of apnoea ( short pauses the respiratory ) in infants . 
their respiratory should be monitored for 3 days after vaccination . 
why has hbvaxpro been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) concluded that suppression thiomersal vaccines do reduced not their efficacy at protection against infection with hepatitis b virus , but reduce their risk .

2 it is recommended to administer the vaccine by any regimens listed . 
infants receiving the schedule at range short ( 0 , 1 , 2 months ) should receive a booster dose to 12 months for high levels of antibodies . 
booster dose : 
immunocompétents subjects 
the need for a booster dose in immunocompetent individuals who have had an full primary vaccination course has not been established . 
however , some forms of vaccination local marked currently a recommendation for a booster dose and they must be respectés . 
subjects with ( e. g. subjects dialysis , subjects following ) 
in vaccinated individuals , additional doses of vaccine should be recommended if the potency of antibodies against the surface antigen of hepatitis b virus ( anti-aghbs ) is less than 10 iu / l . 
revaccination non-répondeurs subjects 
when subjects non-répondeurs after the primary vaccination are revaccinés , 15-25 of them produce an antibody response satisfactorily after administration of an additional dose and 30-50 after administration of three doses . 
however , due to insufficient data safety of the vaccine hepatitis b when the number of doses administered excède the number of recommended doses , the revaccination of subjects who undergone complete primary vaccination is not systematically recommended . 
the revaccination should be considered for those at high risk , after evaluated the benefits of vaccination and the potential risks of increase of side effects local and disorders . 
special recommendations : 
recommendations for neonates of mothers porteuses of hepatitis b virus 
- at the injection tacrolimus anti-hépatite b immunoglobulin ( within 24 hours ) . 
it can be 
given the tacrolimus , at the same time as the injection of immunoglobulins anti-hépatite b , but in a injection site séparé . 
- subsequent vaccine should be given according to recommendations 
local of vaccination . 
exposure recommendations for known or présumée at hepatitis b virus ( e. g. pricking with a needle contaminated by sewage ) : 
- administration immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b as soon as possible after exposure ( within 24 
- the injection of the first dose of vaccine should be performed within 7 days of exposure . 
it can be given at the same time as the injection of immunoglobulins anti-hépatite b , but in a injection site séparé . 
- monitoring sérologique is also recommended , with subsequent of the vaccine , if 
necessary ( i. e. by the status sérologique of the patient ) , for protection short and long-term use . 
- in people not vaccinées or incomplètement vaccinées further , immunisation 
should be take by pictures vaccination recommended . 
the schedule accelerated including the booster vaccination to 12 months may be supplied . 
3 method of administration this vaccine should be injected intramuscularly . 
in neonates and infants , the injection used préférentiellement in the upper antéro-latérale of the thigh . 
in children and adolescents , the injection used preferably in the deltoid muscle . 
do not be administered intravascularly . 
exceptionally , this vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders . 
see section 6.6 for instructions on preparation . 
contraindications 
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients 
- severe fébriles infections 
special warnings and precautions for use 
since the long incubation period of hepatitis b , it is possible that infection not diagnosed either presents at the time of vaccination . 
in such cases , it may vaccination do prevents not infection by the hepatitis b 
the vaccine will not prevent infection caused by the hepatitis a , hepatitis c , hepatitis e or other agents pathogènes known to infect others the liver . 
as with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment should always be immediately available , due to rare anaphylactic reaction occurring after the administration of the vaccine . 
this vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and thiocyanate potassium used during the holder of the vaccine . 
therefore , hypersensitivity reactions may occur . 
because of the benefit high of vaccination in these infants , the administration should not be discontinued or reportée . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
this vaccine may be given : 
- with immunoglobulins anti-hépatite b , use a injection site séparé . 
- to complete a primary vaccination or be used as a booster dose in subjects who received at 
past another vaccine against hepatitis b. 
- in combination with other vaccines using injection sites séparés and syringes

22 it is recommended to administer the vaccine by any regimens listed . 
people receiving the schedule at range short ( 0 , 1 , 2 months ) should receive a booster dose to 12 months for high levels of antibodies . 
booster dose : 
immunocompétents subjects 
the need for a booster dose in immunocompetent individuals who have had an full primary vaccination course has not been established . 
however , some forms of vaccination local marked currently a recommendation for a booster dose and they must be respectés . 
subjects with ( e. g. subjects dialysis , transplant organ ) 
in vaccinated individuals , additional doses of vaccine should be recommended if the potency of antibodies against the surface antigen of hepatitis b virus ( anti-aghbs ) is less than 10 iu / l . 
revaccination non-répondeurs subjects 
when subjects non-répondeurs after the primary vaccination are revaccinés , 15-25 of them produce an antibody response satisfactorily after administration of an additional dose and 30-50 after administration of three doses . 
however , due to insufficient data safety of the vaccine hepatitis b when the number of doses administered excède the number of recommended doses , the revaccination of subjects who undergone complete primary vaccination is not systematically recommended . 
the revaccination should be considered for those at high risk , after evaluated the benefits of vaccination and the potential risks of increase of side effects local and disorders . 
special exposure recommendations for known or présumée at hepatitis b virus ( e. g. pricking with a needle contaminated by sewage ) : 
- administration immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b as soon as possible after exposure ( within 24 
hours ) . 
- the injection of the first dose of vaccine should be performed within 7 days of exposure . 
it can be given at the same time as the injection of immunoglobulins anti-hépatite b , but in a injection site séparé . 
- monitoring sérologique is also recommended , with subsequent of the vaccine , if 
necessary ( i. e. by the status sérologique of the patient ) for protection short and long-term use . 
- in people not vaccinées or incomplètement vaccinated further , immunisation should 
be take by pictures vaccination recommended . 
the schedule accelerated including the booster vaccination to 12 months may be supplied .

some factors may impair the immune response to hepatitis b vaccines 
these factors include age , the genre male , obesity , the tabac , the route of administration and some conditions sous-jacentes . 
monitoring sérologique should be considered in patients who for which it is a risk of do not level the seroprotection after complete primovaccination . 
additional doses may be considered in people who respond little or no to vaccination . 
the vaccine will not prevent infection caused by the hepatitis a , hepatitis c , hepatitis e or other agents pathogènes known to infect others the liver .

findings scientifiques and on the changes of the marketing authorisation holder of hbvaxpro presented by the emea 
hbvaxpro is a vaccine monovalent shown at the site for active immunisation against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis b virus , in all groups âges presented at risk of exposure to this virus . 
the active substance of hbvaxpro , vaccine ( technology ) against hepatitis b surface antigen , is of hepatitis b virus ( aghbs ) , purified and technology . 
hbvaxpro is a vaccine that induces a specific cell and antibody immune response against the aghbs , resulting in a active immunisation against infection caused by the hepatitis b 
the benefits of hbvaxpro are protection effective against hepatitis b in all groups âges in the absence of thimérosal in the product fini . 
problems related to the relatively low immunogenicity component hepatitis b ( hepb ) in vaccines containing the component recombinant hepatitis b produced by spmsd have been evaluated and extensively débattus by the chmp and its groups of physical work ( biotechnology , vaccines ) . 
the 26 may 2005 , the chmp decided necessary of réunir a group of experts &apos;assessment ad hoc on protection short-term and long-term against hepatitis conférée by vaccines encoding against hepatitis b. 
the chmp interroge on that there is a variability shown response in antibodies against hepatitis b not anticipated after vaccination with hexavac . 
this variability appears to be related to changes currently not contrôlables of process holder component of the vaccine technology hepb . 
the concerns portaient on the low immunogenicity hepb component of hexavac , the consequences possible on long-term protection against infection with hepatitis b and vaccination of booster dose after primary vaccination course with this vaccine . 
during its réunion plénière of january 2006 , the chmp confirmed its concern regarding the decreased immunogenicity recombinant component hep b contents in hbvaxpro and procomvax . 
the committee discuté current lack of connaissances on the clinical relevance of findings and immunological memory usually and decided that these problems had to be scrupuleusement performed before taking is of bottle . 
the committee also seen that the final study in infants less than one year has been performed in 2001 . 
therefore , the data up to date should be interpreted with caution because they applies to a paediatric dose ( 5 g ) of the vaccine hep b product before 2001 . 
it semblerait as the vaccine hep b currently product is least immunogène as the vaccine product within prograf / prograft . 
the reason of decreased immunogenicity on several years has not yet been identified . 
it was decided that a decision would be taking depending on the responses eaten to questions about quality and clinical concern . 
the 13 february 2006 , the european commission ( this ) was an open- label study the procedure formulated with article 20 of règlement ( this ) n 726 / 2004 , after the chmp has expressed its concern regarding the low immunogenicity hepb component of hbvaxpro . 
1 discussion 
from the quality , there are no outil recombinant , analytique or animal able to predict the immunogenicity of ingredients encoding hepb in humans . 
any tools analytiques may be used as criteria cohérence , but not as corrélats for the safety and efficacy ( immunogenicity ) batch release hepb products by spmsd . 
however , the new model supplied not it is no p-value prévision before you have been completely validated and after shown its ability to to the coagulation of hbvaxpro who achieved a immune response high of those who achieved a immune response low during clinical trials . 
although the mechanism first of the decreased immunogenicity during the 5 years are not yet determined , it has been prouvé that the process holder was now better monitored . 
the tamm has shown at the site a process holder improved to increase the immunogenicity . 
among data investigated by the chmp figuraient those 7 studies on hbvaxpro and procomvax , one is still ongoing . 
these trials were performed on different groups at risk and âges groups including children neonates are of mothers positives to hepatitis b , infants healthy young adults , and healthy subjects aged 16 to 35 years . 
in studies with the tamm to date on hbvaxpro and procomvax , clinical seroprotection were achieved in the high majority of vaccinated . 
no evidence of the impact on the cover short or long-term has been identified . 
in addition , a study of clinical assessed by with protection against the disease , since the note the trial v121-018 , support that vaccines against hepatitis b are effective to reduce infection with hepatitis b and its serious sequelae . 
due to the relatively high risk of infection , the group of infants neonates are of mothers positives to hepatitis b is the most population vulnérable to a immunogenicity inadequate possible of the vaccine . 
as there are currently no causal an increased number of cases acute hepatitis b after vaccination with hbvaxpro , considering the fact that the eu is a area weakly endémique , no problem safety immediate there could be identified by the chmp . 
the results of these three trials on the product made in the current facilities confirm of solid performance and reproductibles récentes fondées on these data historiques and allow also consider of performance comparable among other populations . 
in clinical expériences spent , a high performance obtained in adolescents and young adults was still been accompanied by a high performance in infants . 
therefore , the results of this study prouvent that the product currently available procure the planned of protective antibodies in all populations for which it is used . 
the chmp was entendu with the tamm on the révision information on product for all formulations of hbvaxpro , to be possible advice and suggestions émis during the procedure . 
the spc and the package leaflets révisés gave information to day on the better use of the medicinal product , because of monthly data . 
these changes , normally , respond to questions soulevées by the chmp and its groups of physical work . 
the decision the results of studies , the tamm was committed to change the sections 4.2 , 4.4 , 4.5 ( if necessary ) and 5.1 of spc as follows : 
the chmp was studied in list all data techniques and clinical data for hbvaxpro . 
the chmp concluded that the use of this vaccine do not risk had immediate , irrespective of the target for which the vaccine is indicated . 
the potential risks restants will be reduced to acceptable by the rpc révisé completely . 
information will be transmises medical or healthcare professionals and assureront the correct use of the vaccine within different groups of âges and categories at risk . 
the committee avalisé the new information on product and has convenu of clore the procedure formulated with article 20 without measure of bottle other . 
3 grounds the changes of the marketing authorisation holder of hbvaxpro 
considérant that 
the chmp thinks that information on the product of hbvaxpro should be affected to make sure the sûreté and efficacy of the clinical use for the following reasons : 
because of data on the low immunogenicity available to date , the chmp decided that it was necessary to give other studies to make sure , the avenir , long-term protection against hepatitis b vaccine with the current ; 
the use of this vaccine does not immediate risk , irrespective of the target for which the vaccine is indicated . 
the potential risks restants will be minimisés to acceptable by changes in depth of rpc ; 
the chmp decided that balance of hbvaxpro for protection against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis b virus , in all groups âges presented at risk of exposure to this virus , remains favourable . 
the committee recommended that the marketing authorisation for hbvaxpro per affected , in accordance with article 5 , section 2 , règlement ( this ) n 726 / 2004 .

first , the patient prélève two samples air expiré , using tubular or liquid provided with helicobacter infai test . 
the patient is then a meal of a ( corresponding to 200 ml pur orange juice , either 1 g of citric acid diluted in 200 ml of water ) , then the solution powder helicobacter test infai diluted water . 
finally , 30 minutes after bu the solution , the patient prélève samples two new air expiré . 
in children aged 3 to 11 years , the meal of a should include 100 ml of pur orange juice . 
for more information on the way is déroule this test , see the package leaflet . 
pylori in carbon dioxide which also contains 13c . 
this carbon dioxide administration may be measured by of laboratoires spécialisés using a mass recombinant called spectrométrie of . 
if there is no carbon dioxide administration in the air expiré , it may reached to a lack of bacteria in the stomach or duodénum . 
how has infai test helicobacter been studied ? 
helicobacter infai test has been tested in four studies in adults involving a total of 561 patients and a study on 335 children and adolescents .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
helicobacter test infai can be used for diagnosis in vivo infection gastroduodénale to helicobacter pylori in : 
- adults 
- adolescents likely to suffer from a peptic ulcer . 
this medicinal product is for use diagnosis only . 
posology and method of administration 
this medicinal product must be administered by a healthcare professional under medical supervision . 
helicobacter test respiratory infai is a test to single administration . 
the dose for adults and adolescents from the age group 12 years of age is a pot 75 mg . 
the patient should be fasting for more than 6 hours , preferably at . 
the modified lasts approximately 40 minutes . 
if the should be repeated , it should not be before the next . 
the éradication of helicobacter pylori may give you positive negative results . 
therefore the should be adjusted after 4 weeks duration minumum systemic antibacterial without treatment and at 2 weeks after the last dose of agents antisécrétoires amino . 
these two treatments could interfere on the presence of helicobacter pylori . 
this is particularly important after treatment of éradication of helicobacter . 
it is important to adhere to control the instructions for use described in section 6.6 ( instructions for use and handling , and disposal ) without which the validité of finding should be uncertain . 
contraindications 
( posology and method of administration ) . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
a test positive alone is not an indication of treatment of éradication . 
a diagnostic measures differential with endoscopiques invasive may be necessary regard for the presence of other conditions such as a ulcer , gastritis autoimmune and malignancies . 
there are no adequate data regarding the inherent of helicobacter test infai to recommend use in patients undergoing a gastrectomie and in patients aged below 12 years of age . 
for children over 3 years , the infai helicobacter for âges 3 to 11 years is available . 
in cases of gastrite-a special ( gastritis atrophique ) , the respiratory test results may give you positive positive , therefore other tests may be required to confirm the presence of helicobacter pylori . 
in case of vomiting during the course of test requiring repeat treatment , it should be adjusted fasting but not before the next , is documented section 4.2 ( posology and method of administration ) . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
helicobacter test infai may be affected by all treatments that interfere with helicobacter pylori or the activity of the uréase . 
pregnancy and lactation 
anything do laisse predict of some nocivité of this test during pregnancy or breast-feeding . 
it is recommended to consider the package leaflet information of treatments of éradication for their administered during pregnancy or breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
helicobacter infai test has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines . 
undesirable effects 
no effect known . 
overdose 
no overdose is to craindre given that it is can 75 mg 13c-urée . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : other diagnostic agents , atc code : 
no pharmacological activity has been described for the amount of 75 mg 13c-urée administered by taking during respiratory test . 
3 after oral administration , urea branded reached mucosa . 
in the presence of helicobacter pylori , the 13c-urée is metabolised by the uréase of helicobacter pylori by reaction : 
2 h2n ( 13co ) nh2 2 2h2o 
enzyme uréase 
4nh3 2 13co2 
carbon dioxide partitions through of blood vessels . 
then it is carried as hydrogen carbonate until lung and disposed as 13co2 with the air exhalé . 
in the presence of uréase bacterial , the proportion of carbons isotopes 13c / 12c is affected significantly . 
the amount of 13co2 in respiratory samples is determined by spectrométrie of mass ( irms ) and expressed by difference absolute ( the ) between the p-value 00 minute and to 30 minutes . 
the uréase is produced in the stomach , only by helicobacter pylori . 
other bacteria productrices of uréases are rarely present in the gastric flora . 
compared to diagnostics biopsiques of infection to helicobacter pylori , susceptibility of test breathing , in clinical studies on 457 adult patients , achieved what 96,5 97,9 ( ci -ci : 
94,05 -99,72 ) and its spécificité 96.7 to 100 ( 95 -ci : 
-103,63 ) , whereas in trials 93 adolescents between 12 and 17 years , the sensitivity of respiratory test reaches 97,7 ( 90 -ci : 
91.3 ) and its spécificité 96,0 ( 90 -ci : 
89,7 ) . 
in the absence of uréase bacterial , the total amount of urea administered , after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract , will be metabolised as urea endogenous . 
ammonia which one released , as described above , with the hydrolysis bacterial is incorporated into the metabolism as nh4 . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the 13c-urée administered orally , is metabolised in carbon dioxide and ammonia or intégré in enterohepatic endogenous urea . 
any increased 13co2 will be as measured by analysis isotopique . 
the absorption and the distribution of 13co2 are more rapid that the uréase . 
therefore , the cleavage of the 13 c-urée by the uréase of helicobacter pylori is step limitante of process full . 
there is than in patients positive to helicobacter pylori that the administration of 75 mg urea branded causes a significant increase of 13co2 in the sample breathing , within 30 minutes .

then it is carried as hydrogen carbonate until lung and disposed as 13co2 with the air exhalé . 
in the presence of uréase bacterial , the proportion of carbons isotopes 13c / 12c is affected significantly . 
the amount of 13co2 in respiratory samples is determined by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive ( ndir ) and expressed by difference absolute ( the ) between the p-value 00 minute and to 30 minutes . 
the uréase is produced in the stomach , only by helicobacter pylori . 
other bacteria productrices of uréases are rarely present in the gastric flora . 
the site limit to tell between tests negative and tests positive to helicobacter pylori is determined by an 4 , which means that there is an infection when the p-value is greater than 4 . 
compared to diagnosis biopsiques of infection to helicobacter pylori , susceptibility of test breathing , in clinical studies in adults , achieved 457 patients 96,5 to 97,9 ( ci -ci : 
94,05 -99,72 ) and its spécificité 96.7 to 100 ( 95 -ci : 
in the absence of uréase bacterial , the total amount of urea administered , after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract , will be metabolised as urea endogenous . 
ammonia which one released , as described above , with the hydrolysis bacterial is incorporated into the metabolism as nh4 . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the 13c-urée administered orally , is metabolised in carbon dioxide and ammonia or intégré in enterohepatic endogenous urea . 
any increased 13co2 will be as measured by analysis isotopique . 
the absorption and the distribution of 13co2 are more rapid that the uréase . 
therefore , the cleavage of the 13 c-urée by the uréase of helicobacter pylori is step limitante of process full . 
there is than in patients positive to helicobacter pylori that the administration of 75 mg urea branded causes a significant increase of 13co2 in the sample breathing , within 30 minutes .

analysis of the proportion of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase part of package for diagnosis helicobacter infai test . 
the exactitude of test is intimement related to the quality of the respiratory analysis . 
the specification the respiratory analysis parameters such as the linearity , the stability ( précision of gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for exactitude nervous system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis is directed by of laboratoires qualifiés . 
it is recommended that you make the analysis as soon as possible after collect the respiratory samples and in no case after 4 weeks . 
the method validée for this use is as follows : 
preparation of samples for analysis spectrométrique infrarouge ( ndir ) 
the rate of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase respiratory samples is determined directly into the gas breathing expiré . 
the gas breathing within tubes is introduit in the spectromètre ndir using pump gas . 
the content of water respiratory sample is maintained about constant by a piège to water nafion . 
the air devoid of co2 reference ( gas ) required for étalonnage and to the measurement is produced using a absorbeur of co2 intégré to the analyseur . 
infrarouge spectrométrique analysis 
for analyser the gas anhydrase contents in the gas breathing , a wide band rayonnement émis with source infrarouge is dirigé turn to turn towards the chamber is a chamber and reference using a hâcheur of beam . 
it is used for détecteurs of transmission to double layer with a chamber before and chamber back syringes each a of gas isotopiquement purs to measure respectively ( 13co2 and 12co2 ) . 
in the chamber is , the rayonnement infrarouge is affaibli by the component gazeux to measure , which perturbe balance between the beam of measure and the reference beam . 
a fluctuation of temperature occurs and ensures a fluctuation the pressure in the chamber before of détecteur infrarouge . 
a condensateur membrane relié to this chamber and exposed to a 
a system of introduction semi-automatique are given the gas is in amounts assessed in the reference gas circulating in the circuit of spectromètre infrarouge . 
this helps to measure the 13c / 12c all co2 concentrations than 1 . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of respiratory test is based on the oral administration urea étiquetée 13c whose is followed by enzymatic hydrolysis , but it also measured by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive the 13co2 within gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètres infrarouges for gas respiratory should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum three analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation safe opportunity : 
storage parameters surgery and results with opportunity protected to avoid further manipulations 
to ensure the specification , tests linearity , stability and précision measures should be performed . 
adjust the site zero of détecteurs using the reference gas généré by the spectromètre . 
there are infection to helicobacter pylori if the difference between the proportion of 13c / 12c baseline and that checked after 30 minutes is greater than 4.0 . 
other methods properly evaluated may be used with laboratoires objectivement qualifiés .

the following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only : 
analysis of the test and specification samples for laboratoires 
respiratory samples extraction tubes recueillis in the glass and plastic 10 ml are analysed by the isotope mass ratio spectrométrie ( irms ) . 
the specification spectromètre of mass of parameters such as the linearity , the stability ( précision of gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for l exactitude nervous system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis either performed with laboratoires qualifiés . 
the validée method is is as follows : 
preparing the sample 
to determine the proportion 13c / 12c of gas anhydrase the respiratory by mass spectrométrie of the gas anhydrase should be isolated of l sample breathing and introduit in the spectromètre of mass . 
the system of preparation mass automatic for spectromètres of isotopiques used for the analysis of the respiratory test is based on a recombinant séparation by chromatographie do to continued flow . 
the water is extracted of l sample with a piège to water nafion or by the preparation of chromatographie do which sépare each gas in a column of chromatographie do with l hélium as éluent . 
moving into the column , all types of gas respiratory are detected by a détecteur ionique . 
the amount of gas anhydrase , identified through retention time characteristic , is inserted into the spectromètre of mass . 
analysis by mass spectrométrie of 
for analyser the gas anhydrase isolated from the sample , its molecules should be ionisées , special beam , accélérées by a champ électrique , déviées by a champ resonance imaging and finalement detected . 
these five steps s effectuent in l analyseur a mass spectromètre of which is represented three parts divided : the source , the tube and the disposal unit . 
l ionisation , the formation of beam and l fast s effectuent in the source , the area under resonance imaging s effectue at the tube and detection at the disposal unit . 
introduction of l sample 
there is for put the gas anhydrase in l analyseur , several systems of introduction . 
for the analysis of the test breathing , l équilibrage assessment of the gas anhydrase of l sample to a reference gas standard is essential . 
this provided high exactitude to this system , when the calculation of contents isotopique of gas anhydrase is achieved by compared to a standard indépendant . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of respiratory test is based on the administration of urea specifically étiquetée 13c including the metabolism is follow-up , but it also measured the 13co2 within gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètre of mass should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum three analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation 
safe opportunity : 
adjustment : 
storage parameters surgery and results with opportunity protected to avoid further manipulations proportion of 13c / 12c with the pdb ( pee dee beliminate ) 
boucle of sample : 
tests to check the specification are linearity , the stability ( précision of gas ) and the reference précision measures . 
all spectromètres of mass for analysis of the respiratory should respond to spécification follows : 
0.5 for samples respiratory including the concentration of linearity : 
co2 varies between 1 and 7 0.2 on 10 pulses due stability : 0.3 for 13c in abondance neutralization using a tube of measure : shortness of 10ml with a concentration of 3 of co2 respiratory 
there are infection to helicobacter pylori if the difference between the proportion of 13c / 12c baseline and that checked after 30 minutes is greater than 4.0 .

the following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only : 
analysis of the test and specification samples for laboratoires 
respiratory , samples recueilli in a sac of 100 ml , are analysed by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive ( ndir ) . 
the analysis of the proportion of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase is part intégrante of package for diagnosis helicobacter infai test . 
l exactitude of test is intimement related to the quality of the respiratory analysis . 
the specification the respiratory analysis parameters such as the linearity , 53 stability ( précision of gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for l exactitude nervous system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis either performed with laboratoires qualifiés . 
it is recommended that you make the analysis as soon as possible after collect the respiratory samples and in no case after 4 weeks . 
the validée method is is as follows : 
preparation of samples for the spectrométrie infrarouge 
the rate of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase respiratory samples is determined directly into the gas breathing expiré . 
the gas breathing within tubes is introduit in the spectromètre ndir using pump gas . 
the content of water respiratory sample is maintained about constant by a piège to water nafion . 
the air devoid of co2 reference ( gas ) required for étalonnage and to the measurement is produced using a absorbeur of co2 intégré to the analyseur . 
infrarouge spectrométrique analysis 
for analyser the gas anhydrase contents in the gas breathing , a wide band rayonnement émis with source infrarouge is dirigé turn to turn towards the chamber is a chamber and reference using a hacheur of beam . 
it is used for détecteurs of transmission to double layer with a chamber before and chamber back syringes each a of gas isotopiquement purs to measure respectively ( 13co2 or 12co2 ) . 
in the chamber is , the rayonnement infrarouge is affaibli by the component gazeux to measure , which perturbe balance between the beam of measure and the reference beam . 
a fluctuation of temperature occurs and ensures a fluctuation the pressure in the chamber before of détecteur infrarouge . 
a condensateur membrane relié to this chamber and exposed to a common upper continued of resistance a source the pressure fluctuations in common alternatif , which helps to measure the statement isotopique of gas anhydrase present in the gas breathing . 
introduction of sample 
a system of introduction semi-automatique are given the gas is in amounts assessed in the reference gas circulating in the circuit of spectromètre infrarouge . 
this helps to measure the relationship 13c / 12c all co2 concentrations than 1 . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of respiratory test is based on the oral administration urea étiquetée 13c whose is followed by enzymatic hydrolysis , but it also measured by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive the 13co2 within gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètre infrarouge for gas respiratory should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum three analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation safe opportunity : 
storage parameters surgery and results with opportunity protected to avoid further manipulations 
to ensure the specification , tests linearity , stability and précision measures should be performed . 
adjust the site zero of détecteurs using the reference gas généré by the spectromètre . 
adjust the site end of détecteurs using gas of étalonnage including concentration is known . 
0.5 for samples respiratory including the concentration of linearity : 
co2- varies between 1 and 7 0.3 on 10 pulses due stability : 0.5 for 13c in abondance neutralization using a tube of measure : shortness of 100ml with a concentration of 3 of co2 respiratory 
there are infection to helicobacter pylori if the difference between the proportion of 13c / 12c baseline and that checked after 30 minutes is greater than 4.0 .

analysis of the test and specification samples for laboratoires 
respiratory , samples recueilli in a sac of 100 ml , are analysed by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive ( ndir ) . 
the analysis of the proportion of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase is part intégrante of package for diagnosis helicobacter infai test . 
l exactitude of test is intimement related to the quality of the respiratory analysis . 
the specification the respiratory analysis parameters such as the linearity , the 62 stability ( précision of gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for l exactitude nervous system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis either performed with laboratoires qualifiés . 
it is recommended that you make the analysis as soon as possible after collect the respiratory samples and in no case after 4 weeks . 
the validée method is is as follows : 
preparation of samples for the spectrométrie infrarouge 
the gas breathing within tubes is introduit in the spectromètre ndir using pump gas . 
the content of water respiratory sample is maintained about constant by a piège to water nafion . 
the air devoid of co2 reference ( gas ) required for étalonnage and to the measurement is produced using a absorbeur of co2 intégré to the analyseur . 
infrarouge spectrométrique analysis 
for analyser the gas anhydrase contents in the gas breathing , a wide band rayonnement émis with source infrarouge is dirigé turn to turn towards the chamber is a chamber and reference using a hacheur of beam . 
in the chamber is , the rayonnement infrarouge is affaibli by the component gazeux to measure , which perturbe balance between the beam of measure and the reference beam . 
a fluctuation of temperature occurs and ensures a fluctuation the pressure in the chamber before of détecteur infrarouge . 
introduction of sample 
a system of introduction semi-automatique are given the gas is in amounts assessed in the reference gas circulating in the circuit of spectromètre infrarouge . 
this helps to measure the relationship 13c / 12c all co2 concentrations than 1 . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of respiratory test is based on the oral administration urea étiquetée 13c whose is followed by enzymatic hydrolysis , but it also measured by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive the 13co2 within gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètre infrarouge for gas respiratory should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum three analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation safe opportunity :

helixate nexgen contains the active substance octocog alfa recombinant coagulation ( factor viii ) . 
what is helixate nexgen used for ? 
helixate nexgen is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia has a bleeding disorder ( inherited due to a lack of factor viii ) . 
helixate nexgen is intended for use only short or long-term use . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how to helixate nexgen used for ? 
treatment with helixate nexgen should be prescribed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of haemophilia . 
helixate nexgen is given by injection into a vein ( intravenously ) during a few minutes , at a rate of 2 ml per minute at maximum . 
the dose and frequency are assessed by that helixate nexgen is used for the treatment of bleeding ( bleeding ) or to prevent the during surgery . 
the dose is adjusted depending on the severity of the haemorrhage or the type of surgery . 
helixate nexgen may also be given by continuous infusion ( drip into a vein ) for at least 7 days in patients undergoing high surgery . 
for a full details on how to determine doses , please see the package leaflet . 
how to helixate nexgen been studied ? 
the active substance of helixate nexgen , octocog alfa , is a protein which is a blood coagulation factor . 
in the body , factor viii is one of the substances ( factors ) involved in the process blood coagulation . 
patients with haemophilia has a lack factor viii , which causes blood coagulation problems , such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs . 
helixate nexgen is used to replace the missing factor viii . 
it corrects the factor viii and gives temporary control of bleeding disorders . 
octocog alfa is not extracted of human plasma , but produced by a method known as recombinant dna technology : it is made by a cell that has received a gene ( dna ) , which makes it able to produce factor viii adsorption . 
7 westferry circus , canary wharf , london e14 4hb , uk tel . 
helixate nexgen is similar to medicine kogenate , but is prepared differently , so that there is no proteins human- in the medicine . 
helixate nexgen was also studied as a continuous infusion with 15 patients with haemophilia has undergoing programmes high . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the assessment of the doctor on discontinuation effectif of bleeding . 
what benefit demonstrated by helixate nexgen during the studies ? 
in previously treated patients , overall , ci haemorrhage responded to one or two injections of helixate intraveineuses nexgen . 
in previously untreated patients , approximately 90 of bleeding responded to treatment with one or two injections intraveineuses . 
when helixate nexgen was given by continuous infusion , discontinuation of bleeding was evaluated as excellent for the 15 patients . 
what is the risk associated with the use of helixate nexgen ? 
patients with haemophilia has may develop antibodies ( inhibitors ) factor viii . 
an antibody is a protein produced by the body in reaction to unknown agents , it part of the natural defence system of the body . 
in clinical trials with helixate nexgen , this is produced in 14 of patients who had received any treatment previously and 17 of children who had previously treatment than 100 days . 
if the antibodies develop , helixate nexgen not working effectively . 
hypersensitivity ( allergic reactions ) has occasionally been seen in patients treated with factor viii-containing products . 
helixate nexgen should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to factor viii recombinant coagulation , mouse protein or hamster or to any of the other ingredients . 
why has nexgen helixate been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) decided that helixate nexgen &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks in the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia has ( congenital factor viii ) . 
the committee recommended that a marketing authorisation holder is given helixate nexgen .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia has ( congenital factor viii ) . 
this preparation does not contain factor von willebrand disease and therefore should not be used in the treatment of the disease of willebrand disease . 
posology and method of administration 
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia . 
posology the number of units factor viii administered is expressed in international units ( iu ) compared to standard current the who concentrates for of factors viii . 
the factor viii activity in plasma is expressed either as percentage ( relative to human plasma normal ) , or in international units ( relative to a standard international for factor viii in plasma ) . 
a international units ( iu ) of factor viii corresponds to the amount of factor viii in one ml of normal human plasma . 
2 the calculation of the required dose factor viii is basis on the outcome empirical as 1 international units ( iu ) of factor viii per kg body weight increases the factor viii activity plasma 1.5 1.5-2.5 . 
the required dose determined using the following formulas : 
i. 
nb of iu = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor viii rise ( of normal ) x 0.5 
increase expected factor viii rise ( of normal ) = 2 x nb of iu given body weight ( kg ) 
the doses and duration of treatment replacement should be adapted depending on the requirement ( weight , severity of disorders of haemostasis , site and rate of bleeding , titre in for inhibitor and factor viii levels level ) . 
the following table gives indicatif values epidural pharmacokinetics of plasma levels of factor viii to obtain . 
in case of the described bleeding , the factor viii activity should not chuter below of levels indicated ( in of normal ) for the shelf stated .

the dose and frequency of administration should always be adapted to each individual cases based on clinical efficacy noted . 
in some circumstances , doses higher than those calculated may be necessary , especially during the first administration . 
during treatment , a measure appropriate of factor viii levels is recommended to evaluate the dose to be administered and the frequency at which repeat infusions . 
in the case of major surgery , follow-up précis treatment replacement via an coagulation analysis ( plasma factor viii ) is indispensable . 
responses of patients in the individual factor viii may vary , resulting in a blood in vivo recovery and different half-life . 
4 a clinical study in adult patients with haemophilia has undergoing a surgery showed that helixate nexgen can be used by continuous infusion surgery ( in pre- , per- and postoperative ) . 
in this study , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlébites infusion site as with any intravenous infusion long-term use . 
helixate nexgen contains a low blood polysorbate- 80 , excipient known to increase the rate of extraction of do 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from materials polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) . 
this part should be taken into account when by continuous infusion . 
for the treatment prophylactic of bleeding in patients with severe , doses ranging from 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg body weight , should be given every 2 to 3 days . 
in some cases , especially in the younger patients , more frequent injections between the dose or higher doses may be necessary . 
the data were obtained in 61 children aged less than 6 years . 
cases of patients with inhibitors 
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii . 
if the levels of activity factor viii in plasma is not controlled , or if bleeding are not controlled with the appropriate doses , the presence of a factor viii should be evaluated using those laboratory tests . 
if an inhibitor is present to a titre below 10 units ( bu ) ( bu ) per ml , the administration of a dose additional factor viii technology may neutraliser the and to identify continue to obtain a clinical response to treatment with helixate nexgen . 
however , in the presence of a doses necessary are variable and should be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical response and strength of the plasma factor viii . 
in patients with the potency of the exceeds 10 bu or with high anamnestique response , the use of a concentrate of prothrombique complex activated or vii factor activated technology ( rfviia ) should be considered . 
such treatments should be a by physicians experienced in the normal to treat patients with haemophilia a. 
method of administration dissolve the preparation as directed in section 6.6 . 
helixate nexgen should be injected by the intravenous route on several minutes . 
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient convenience maximum ( rate of injection : 
helixate nexgen may be given by continuous infusion . 
the infusion rate should be calculated from clearance and factor viii rise to achieve . 
example : for a patient 75 kg including clearance is 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate would be 3 iu / h / kg to obtain a fviii 100 . 
for calculate in ml / hour should multiply the infusion rate iu / h / kg , with the next &#91; kg body weight / concentration of the solution ( iu / ml ) &#93; . 
5 clearance : 
plasma factor viii levels to achieve 
infusion rate iu / h / kg 
rate of infusion for a patient 75 kg in ml / h concentrations rfviii solution 100 iu / ml 200 iu / ml 400 iu / ml 
( 1 iu / ml ) 60 ( 0.6 iu / ml ) 40 ( 0.4 iu / ml ) 
infusion of vitesses higher may be warranted in situations where clearance is accélérée in important haemorrhage or tissue damage étendues during surgery . 
the infusion vitesses further should be calculated based actual levels factor viii achieved during each days after surgery using the following equation : 
contraindications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance , mouse protein or hamster or to any of the excipients . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
as with any medicinal product species intravenous protein , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible . 
patients should be informed that the onset of chest tightness , dizziness , hypotension mild and nausea during the infusion may constitute the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic . 
symptomatic treatment and the treatment of hypersensitivity should be instaurés . 
in case of allergic or anaphylactic reactions injection or infusion should be immediately discontinued and patients should contact their physician . 
in case of shock , treatment for shock should be initiated . 
antibody formation neutralisant ( inhibitors ) factor viii is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia a. 
these inhibitors are always of immunoglobulin g dirigées against pro-coagulante activity factor viii and are quantifiés in international ( bu ) modified ( bu ) per ml of plasma . 
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated between other , exposure to factor viii and genetic ; this risk is the higher within 20 days at antigen . 
more rarely , inhibitors may occur after the first 100 exposure days . 
cases of recurrent inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after change by a factor viii technology with another in patients treated with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitors . 
patients treated with factor viii technology should be carefully monitored clinically , and the appropriate laboratory tests , to dépister development of inhibitors . 
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects . 
in a clinical study involving the use of continuous infusion surgery , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlebitis infusion site as with any intravenous infusion long-term use . 
in the interest of patients , it is recommended , lorque this is possible , only at each administration of helixate nexgen , the name and batch number of the product is enregistré . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial or essentially sodium free . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no interaction of helixate nexgen with other medicinal products is known . 
pregnancy and lactation 
helixate nexgen has not been studied in animal reproduction studies . 
due to the rarity of haemophilia has in women , there was no data on the use of helixate nexgen in pregnant women or during lactation . 
therefore , helixate nexgen should be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding as if the indication is incontestable . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
helixate nexgen has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines . 
undesirable effects 
after administration of helixate nexgen , it has been observed a few rare cases of undesirable effects minor to moderate as supplied in table : 
system organ class cardiac hématoloqiques and the lymphatic system disorders 
preferred term in meddra preferred term inhibition of factor viii 
general disorders and administration site conditions immune sytème disorders investigations nervous system disorders skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
injection site reaction pyrexia allergic reaction / anaphylaxis abnormal blood pressure dizziness pruritus , rash 
antibody formation neutralisant factor viii ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia a. 
in clinical studies with factor viii technology , development of inhibitors was mainly observed in patients not previously treated . 
therefore , it should be monitored closely patients , clinically and the appropriate laboratory tests , to dépister development of inhibitors . 
in clinical studies , helixate nexgen was used in the treatment of bleeding in 37 patients ( pups ) and patients treated with minima ( mtps , defined as who had at maximum 4 exposure days ) . 
five of 37 pups ( 14 ) and 4 of 23 mtps ( 17 ) receiving helixate nexgen developed inhibitors : 
6 patients on 60 ( 10 ) with a titre greater than 10 bu and 3 patients on 60 ( 5 ) with a titre below 10 bu . 
3 to 18 days ) . 
the number of days mean exposure in clinical trials was 114 ( extreme case 4-478 ) . 
four on five patients who had not with 20 exposure days in end of study have finalement passed the 20 days of exposure during the follow-up after the study , and any of them developed was low-titre of inhibitor . 
the one patient was lost sight . 
7 in clinical trials involving 73 previously treated with an , defined as &gt; 100 exposure days ) and monitored for 4 years , no inhibitor of novo has been observed . 
in clinical studies involving carbohydrate during to scale helixate nexgen , enrolled more than 1,000 patients , have been reported : less than 0.2 of ptps developed monoamine novo . 
in a sous-population defined as with less than 20 exposure days to influx of the study , less than 11 developed inbiteurs of novo . 
in clinical studies , no patients have developed clinically significant levels of antibodies against mouse protein or hamster present in trace amounts in the preparation . 
however , the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents , such as traces of mouse and hamster proteins in the preparation , is in some patients prédisposés ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) . 
overdose 
no signs of overdose with factor viii recombinant coagulation has been reported . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : factor viii of clotting , atc code b02bd02 
factor viii and factor von willebrand disease ( fvw ) constituent a complex two molecules for physiologiques different . 
an infusion in a haemophilia patient , factor viii binds to the fvw in the blood stream . 
factor viii acts as a cofactor factor ix , accelerating the conversion of factor x factor x activated . 
factor x converts prothrombin to thrombin . 
haemophilia has is a disease coagulation inherited gender due to a lack of levels in factor viii : 
c that causes multiple bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs or spontaneously or following a cerebrovascular or a surgical . 
aid replacement therapy , the levels in plasma fviii are increased , a correction temporary factor déficitaire and the tendency bleeding . 
the partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) is a classical mean is biological activity of factor viii in vitro . 
it is allongé in all patients . 
the rate and the time of normalisation of aptt observed after administration of helixate nexgen are comparable to obtained with the factor viii species plasma . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
analysis of the in vivo recovery in previously treated showed for helixate nexgen an average increase of plasma factor viii levels of 2 per iu / kg body weight . 
this finding is similar to reported for factor viii human plasma . 
after administration of helixate nexgen , the décroissance of peak factor viii activity is type exponentiel biphasic , with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 15 hours . 
this is similar to that factor viii in plasma including the mean terminal half-life is approximately 13 hours . 
preclinical safety data 
even at doses several times higher than recommended clinical dose ( determined depending on the weight ) , the helixate nexgen has been no acute toxic effect or subaigu in laboratory animals , rabbit ( mouse , rat and dog ) . 
due to the immune response that suscitent protein heterologous strains in all species mammalian , specific studies of repeated dosing ( based on studies become chronic toxicity , reproduction carcinogenicity ) have not been performed with octocog alfa . 
no study mutagenicity of helixate nexgen has been performed as no mutagenic potential had been décelé in vitro or in vivo with the product prédécesseur of helixate nexgen .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia has ( congenital factor viii ) . 
this preparation does not contain factor von willebrand disease and therefore should not be used in the treatment of the disease of willebrand disease . 
posology and method of administration 
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia . 
posology the number of units factor viii administered is expressed in international units ( iu ) compared to standard current the who concentrates for of factors viii . 
the factor viii activity in plasma is expressed either as percentage ( relative to human plasma normal ) , or in international units ( relative to a standard international for factor viii in plasma ) . 
a international units ( iu ) of factor viii corresponds to the amount of factor viii in one ml of normal human plasma . 
11 the calculation of the required dose factor viii is basis on the outcome empirical as 1 international units ( iu ) of factor viii per kg body weight increases the factor viii activity plasma 1.5 1.5-2.5 . 
the required dose determined using the following formulas : 
i. 
nb of iu = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor viii rise ( of normal ) x 0.5 
increase expected factor viii rise ( of normal ) = 2 x nb of iu given body weight ( kg ) 
the doses and duration of treatment replacement should be adapted depending on the requirement ( weight , severity of disorders of haemostasis , site and rate of bleeding , titre in for inhibitor and factor viii levels level ) . 
the following table gives indicatif values epidural pharmacokinetics of plasma levels of factor viii to obtain . 
in case of the described bleeding , the factor viii activity should not chuter below of levels indicated ( in of normal ) for the shelf stated .

( pre and post site ) 
the dose and frequency of administration should always be adapted to each individual cases based on clinical efficacy noted . 
in some circumstances , doses higher than those calculated may be necessary , especially during the first administration . 
during treatment , a measure appropriate of factor viii levels is recommended to evaluate the dose to be administered and the frequency at which repeat infusions . 
in the case of major surgery , follow-up précis treatment replacement via an coagulation analysis ( plasma factor viii ) is indispensable . 
responses of patients in the individual factor viii may vary , resulting in a blood in vivo recovery and different half-life . 
13 a clinical study in adult patients with haemophilia has undergoing a surgery showed that helixate nexgen can be used by continuous infusion surgery ( in pre- , per- and postoperative ) . 
in this study , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlébites infusion site as with any intravenous infusion long-term use . 
helixate nexgen contains a low blood polysorbate- 80 , excipient known to increase the rate of extraction of do 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from materials polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) . 
this part should be taken into account when by continuous infusion . 
for the treatment prophylactic of bleeding in patients with severe , doses ranging from 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg body weight , should be given every 2 to 3 days . 
in some cases , especially in the younger patients , more frequent injections between the dose or higher doses may be necessary . 
the data were obtained in 61 children aged less than 6 years . 
cases of patients with inhibitors 
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii . 
if the levels of activity factor viii in plasma is not controlled , or if bleeding are not controlled with the appropriate doses , the presence of a factor viii should be evaluated using those laboratory tests . 
if an inhibitor is present to a titre below 10 units ( bu ) ( bu ) per ml , the administration of a dose additional factor viii technology may neutraliser the and to identify continue to obtain a clinical response to treatment with helixate nexgen . 
however , in the presence of a doses necessary are variable and should be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical response and strength of the plasma factor viii . 
in patients with the potency of the exceeds 10 bu or with high anamnestique response , the use of a concentrate of prothrombique complex activated or vii factor activated technology ( rfviia ) should be considered . 
such treatments should be a by physicians experienced in the normal to treat patients with haemophilia a. 
method of administration dissolve the preparation as directed in section 6.6 . 
helixate nexgen should be injected by the intravenous route on several minutes . 
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient convenience maximum ( rate of injection : 
helixate nexgen may be given by continuous infusion . 
the infusion rate should be calculated from clearance and factor viii rise to achieve . 
example : for a patient 75 kg including clearance is 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate would be 3 iu / h / kg to obtain a fviii 100 . 
for calculate in ml / hour should multiply the infusion rate iu / h / kg , with the next &#91; kg body weight / concentration of the solution ( iu / ml ) &#93; .

rate of infusion for a patient 75 kg in ml / h concentrations rfviii solution 100 iu / ml 200 iu / ml 400 iu / ml 
( 1 iu / ml ) 60 ( 0.6 iu / ml ) 40 ( 0.4 iu / ml ) 
infusion of vitesses higher may be warranted in situations where clearance is accélérée in important haemorrhage or tissue damage étendues during surgery . 
the infusion vitesses further should be calculated based actual levels factor viii achieved during each days after surgery using the following equation : 
contraindications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance , mouse protein or hamster or to any of the excipients . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
as with any medicinal product species intravenous protein , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible . 
patients should be informed that the onset of chest tightness , dizziness , hypotension mild and nausea during the infusion may constitute the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic . 
symptomatic treatment and the treatment of hypersensitivity should be instaurés . 
in case of allergic or anaphylactic reactions injection or infusion should be immediately discontinued and patients should contact their physician . 
in case of shock , treatment for shock should be initiated . 
antibody formation neutralisant ( inhibitors ) factor viii is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia a. 
these inhibitors are always of immunoglobulin g dirigées against pro-coagulante activity factor viii and are quantifiés in international ( bu ) modified ( bu ) per ml of plasma . 
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated between other , exposure to factor viii and genetic ; this risk is the higher within 20 days at antigen . 
more rarely , inhibitors may occur after the first 100 exposure days . 
cases of recurrent inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after change by a factor viii technology with another in patients treated with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitors . 
patients treated with factor viii technology should be carefully monitored clinically , and the appropriate laboratory tests , to dépister development of inhibitors . 
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects . 
in a clinical study involving the use of continuous infusion surgery , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlebitis infusion site as with any intravenous infusion long-term use . 
in the interest of patients , it is recommended , lorque this is possible , only at each administration of helixate nexgen , the name and batch number of the product is enregistré . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial or essentially sodium free . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no interaction of helixate nexgen with other medicinal products is known .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia has ( congenital factor viii ) . 
this preparation does not contain factor von willebrand disease and therefore should not be used in the treatment of the disease of willebrand disease . 
posology and method of administration 
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia . 
posology the number of units factor viii administered is expressed in international units ( iu ) compared to standard current the who concentrates for of factors viii . 
the factor viii activity in plasma is expressed either as percentage ( relative to human plasma normal ) , or in international units ( relative to a standard international for factor viii in plasma ) . 
a international units ( iu ) of factor viii corresponds to the amount of factor viii in one ml of normal human plasma . 
29 the calculation of the required dose factor viii is basis on the outcome empirical as 1 international units ( iu ) of factor viii per kg body weight increases the factor viii activity plasma 1.5 1.5-2.5 . 
the required dose determined using the following formulas : 
i. 
nb of iu = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor viii rise ( of normal ) x 0.5 
increase expected factor viii rise ( of normal ) = 2 x nb of iu given body weight ( kg ) 
the doses and duration of treatment replacement should be adapted depending on the requirement ( weight , severity of disorders of haemostasis , site and rate of bleeding , titre in for inhibitor and factor viii levels level ) . 
the following table gives indicatif values epidural pharmacokinetics of plasma levels of factor viii to obtain . 
in case of the described bleeding , the factor viii activity should not chuter below of levels indicated ( in of normal ) for the shelf stated . 
rate of haemorrhage / type of acte surgical haemorrhage 
plasma levels necessary factor viii ( ) ( iu / dl ) 
frequency of injections ( hours ) and duration of therapy ( days ) . 
haemarthrosis early , 
at least 1 day , until the end of the bleed indicated 
haemarthrosis and muscle haemorrhage haematoma or haematoma 
repeat the infusion every 12 to 24 hours for 3-4 days or more until foam pain and the disability . 
bleeding episodes life-threatening such as intracranial haemorrhage , haemorrhage of pharynx , haemorrhage severe abdominal surgery 
repeat the infusion every 8 to 24 hours until the resolved vital menace . 
minor including extraction 
every 24 hours , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved . 
major 
to 100 
a ) bolus repeat the infusion every 8 
( pre and post site ) 
the dose and frequency of administration should always be adapted to each individual cases based on clinical efficacy noted . 
in some circumstances , doses higher than those calculated may be necessary , especially during the first administration . 
during treatment , a measure appropriate of factor viii levels is recommended to evaluate the dose to be administered and the frequency at which repeat infusions . 
in the case of major surgery , follow-up précis treatment replacement via an coagulation analysis ( plasma factor viii ) is indispensable . 
responses of patients in the individual factor viii may vary , resulting in a blood in vivo recovery and different half-life . 
31 a clinical study in adult patients with haemophilia has undergoing a surgery showed that helixate nexgen can be used by continuous infusion surgery ( in pre- , per- and postoperative ) . 
in this study , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlébites infusion site as with any intravenous infusion long-term use . 
helixate nexgen contains a low blood polysorbate- 80 , excipient known to increase the rate of extraction of do 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from materials polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) . 
this part should be taken into account when by continuous infusion . 
for the treatment prophylactic of bleeding in patients with severe , doses ranging from 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg body weight , should be given every 2 to 3 days . 
in some cases , especially in the younger patients , more frequent injections between the dose or higher doses may be necessary . 
the data were obtained in 61 children aged less than 6 years . 
cases of patients with inhibitors 
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii . 
if the levels of activity factor viii in plasma is not controlled , or if bleeding are not controlled with the appropriate doses , the presence of a factor viii should be evaluated using those laboratory tests . 
if an inhibitor is present to a titre below 10 units ( bu ) ( bu ) per ml , the administration of a dose additional factor viii technology may neutraliser the and to identify continue to obtain a clinical response to treatment with helixate nexgen . 
however , in the presence of a doses necessary are variable and should be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical response and strength of the plasma factor viii . 
in patients with the potency of the exceeds 10 bu or with high anamnestique response , the use of a concentrate of prothrombique complex activated or vii factor activated technology ( rfviia ) should be considered . 
such treatments should be a by physicians experienced in the normal to treat patients with haemophilia a. 
method of administration dissolve the preparation as directed in section 6.6 . 
helixate nexgen should be injected by the intravenous route on several minutes . 
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient convenience maximum ( rate of injection : 
helixate nexgen may be given by continuous infusion . 
the infusion rate should be calculated from clearance and factor viii rise to achieve . 
example : for a patient 75 kg including clearance is 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate would be 3 iu / h / kg to obtain a fviii 100 . 
for calculate in ml / hour should multiply the infusion rate iu / h / kg , with the next &#91; kg body weight / concentration of the solution ( iu / ml ) &#93; . 
32 clearance : 
plasma factor viii levels to achieve 
infusion rate iu / h / kg 
rate of infusion for a patient 75 kg in ml / h concentrations rfviii solution 100 iu / ml 200 iu / ml 400 iu / ml 
( 1 iu / ml ) 60 ( 0.6 iu / ml ) 40 ( 0.4 iu / ml ) 
infusion of vitesses higher may be warranted in situations where clearance is accélérée in important haemorrhage or tissue damage étendues during surgery . 
the infusion vitesses further should be calculated based actual levels factor viii achieved during each days after surgery using the following equation : 
contraindications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance , mouse protein or hamster or to any of the excipients . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
as with any medicinal product species intravenous protein , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible . 
patients should be informed that the onset of chest tightness , dizziness , hypotension mild and nausea during the infusion may constitute the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic . 
symptomatic treatment and the treatment of hypersensitivity should be instaurés . 
in case of allergic or anaphylactic reactions injection or infusion should be immediately discontinued and patients should contact their physician . 
in case of shock , treatment for shock should be initiated . 
antibody formation neutralisant ( inhibitors ) factor viii is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia a. 
these inhibitors are always of immunoglobulin g dirigées against pro-coagulante activity factor viii and are quantifiés in international ( bu ) modified ( bu ) per ml of plasma . 
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated between other , exposure to factor viii and genetic ; this risk is the higher within 20 days at antigen . 
more rarely , inhibitors may occur after the first 100 exposure days . 
cases of recurrent inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after change by a factor viii technology with another in patients treated with more than 100 exposure days and a history of inhibitors . 
patients treated with factor viii technology should be carefully monitored clinically , and the appropriate laboratory tests , to dépister development of inhibitors . 
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects . 
in a clinical study involving the use of continuous infusion surgery , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlebitis infusion site as with any intravenous infusion long-term use . 
in the interest of patients , it is recommended , lorque this is possible , only at each administration of helixate nexgen , the name and batch number of the product is enregistré . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial or essentially sodium free . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no interaction of helixate nexgen with other medicinal products is known . 
pregnancy and lactation 
helixate nexgen has not been studied in animal reproduction studies . 
due to the rarity of haemophilia has in women , there was no data on the use of helixate nexgen in pregnant women or during lactation . 
therefore , helixate nexgen should be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding as if the indication is incontestable . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
helixate nexgen has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines . 
undesirable effects 
after administration of helixate nexgen , it has been observed a few rare cases of undesirable effects minor to moderate as supplied in table : 
system organ class cardiac hématoloqiques and the lymphatic system disorders 
preferred term in meddra preferred term inhibition of factor viii 
general disorders and administration site conditions immune sytème disorders investigations nervous system disorders skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
injection site reaction pyrexia allergic reaction / anaphylaxis abnormal blood pressure dizziness pruritus , rash 
antibody formation neutralisant factor viii ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia a. 
in clinical studies with factor viii technology , development of inhibitors was mainly observed in patients not previously treated . 
therefore , it should be monitored closely patients , clinically and the appropriate laboratory tests , to dépister development of inhibitors . 
in clinical studies , helixate nexgen was used in the treatment of bleeding in 37 patients ( pups ) and patients treated with minima ( mtps , defined as who had at maximum 4 exposure days ) . 
five of 37 pups ( 14 ) and 4 of 23 mtps ( 17 ) receiving helixate nexgen developed inhibitors : 
6 patients on 60 ( 10 ) with a titre greater than 10 bu and 3 patients on 60 ( 5 ) with a titre below 10 bu . 
3 to 18 days ) . 
the number of days mean exposure in clinical trials was 114 ( extreme case 4-478 ) . 
four on five patients who had not with 20 exposure days in end of study have finalement passed the 20 days of exposure during the follow-up after the study , and any of them developed was low-titre of inhibitor . 
the one patient was lost sight . 
34 in clinical studies involving 73 previously treated with an , defined as &gt; 100 exposure days ) and monitored for 4 years , no inhibitor of novo has been observed . 
in clinical studies involving carbohydrate during to scale helixate nexgen , enrolled more than 1,000 patients , have been reported : less than 0.2 of ptps developed monoamine novo . 
in a sous-population defined as with less than 20 exposure days to influx of the study , less than 11 developed inbiteurs of novo . 
in clinical studies , no patients have developed clinically significant levels of antibodies against mouse protein or hamster present in trace amounts in the preparation . 
however , the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents , such as traces of mouse and hamster proteins in the preparation , is in some patients prédisposés ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 ) . 
overdose 
no signs of overdose with factor viii recombinant coagulation has been reported . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : factor viii of clotting , atc code b02bd02 
factor viii and factor von willebrand disease ( fvw ) constituent a complex two molecules for physiologiques different . 
an infusion in a haemophilia patient , factor viii binds to the fvw in the blood stream . 
factor viii acts as a cofactor factor ix , accelerating the conversion of factor x factor x activated . 
factor x converts prothrombin to thrombin . 
haemophilia has is a disease coagulation inherited gender due to a lack of levels in factor viii : 
c that causes multiple bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs or spontaneously or following a cerebrovascular or a surgical . 
aid replacement therapy , the levels in plasma fviii are increased , a correction temporary factor déficitaire and the tendency bleeding . 
the partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) is a classical mean is biological activity of factor viii in vitro . 
it is allongé in all patients . 
the rate and the time of normalisation of aptt observed after administration of helixate nexgen are comparable to obtained with the factor viii species plasma . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
analysis of the in vivo recovery in previously treated showed for helixate nexgen an average increase of plasma factor viii levels of 2 per iu / kg body weight . 
this finding is similar to reported for factor viii human plasma . 
after administration of helixate nexgen , the décroissance of peak factor viii activity is type exponentiel biphasic , with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 15 hours . 
this is similar to that factor viii in plasma including the mean terminal half-life is approximately 13 hours . 
preclinical safety data 
even at doses several times higher than recommended clinical dose ( determined depending on the weight ) , the helixate nexgen has been no acute toxic effect or subaigu in laboratory animals , rabbit ( mouse , rat and dog ) . 
due to the immune response that suscitent protein heterologous strains in all species mammalian , specific studies of repeated dosing ( based on studies become chronic toxicity , reproduction carcinogenicity ) have not been performed with octocog alfa . 
no study mutagenicity of helixate nexgen has been performed as no mutagenic potential had been décelé in vitro or in vivo with the product prédécesseur of helixate nexgen .
