very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
6 patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of the lower génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to the spc parentales ( e. g. age of the mother and the sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to the risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder must be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent joint . 
in order to avoid the injection of volumes too intervals , it may dissolve up to 3 ampoules or vials of powder in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 iu or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a gonadotrophin-releasing of the hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after the beginning of treatment with a , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after two weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
13 experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 iu or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use gonal-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy 
14 males : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 iu or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
15 high anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
16 patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
22 gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder must be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent joint . 
in order to avoid the injection of volumes too intervals , it may dissolve up to 3 vials of powder in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a gonadotrophin-releasing of the hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks 
23 of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
the experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use gonal-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
24 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
25 ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
26 in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of the lower génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to the spc parentales ( e. g. age of the mother and the sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to the risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
the level of fsh are indicateurs endogenous failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients should répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
27 clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of a syndrome of hyperstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is composed of folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced in cho cell ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the most important from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe lh , fsh and were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account of the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f is given concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already used in other sections of the spc . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses 5 pharmacological of follitropine alfa ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at higher doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these findings were only a small clinical relevance .

it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use gonal-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
35 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
36 ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
37 in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of the lower génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to the spc parentales ( e. g. age of the mother and the sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to the risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
the level of fsh are indicateurs endogenous failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients should répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
38 clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of a syndrome of hyperstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is composed of folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced in cho cell ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the most important from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe lh , fsh and were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account of the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f is given concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already used in other sections of the spc . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses 5 pharmacological of follitropine alfa ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at higher doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these findings were only a small clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
the powder must be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent joint . 
43 37,5 iu ( 2.8 micrograms ) may be dissolved in 1 ml solvent and mixed with gonal-f 75 iu ( 5.5 micrograms ) and / or gonal-f 150 iu ( 11 micrograms ) . 
up to 3 vials of powder can be dissolved in 1 ml solvent . 
the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a gonadotrophin-releasing of the hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks 
44 of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
the experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use gonal-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
45 renal ovarienne packaging malformation of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted .

the amount of ovarienne hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
53 gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
before the first use , the powder must be reconstituted with the solvent joint . 
gonal-f 1.050 iu / 1.75 ml ( 77 micrograms / 1.75 ml ) should not be reconstituted with other ampoules / vials of gonal-f . 
the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a gonadotrophin-releasing of the hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
for example , it will give after the 2 weeks 
54 of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
the experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use gonal-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in the female : 
55 primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients with injecting yourself , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using a multidose presentation . 
gonal-f is at the making several injections , instructions unclear should be provided to avoid poor use of this multidose presentation . 
because of possible local reactions at the benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used for several consecutive days . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
56 no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
57 pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of the lower génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to the spc parentales ( e. g. age of the mother and the sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to the risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
the level of fsh are indicateurs endogenous failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients should répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
58 population sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
gonal-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
before the first use , the powder must be reconstituted with the solvent joint . 
gonal-f 450 iu / 0.75 ml ( 33 micrograms / 0.75 ml ) should not be reconstituted with other ampoules / vials of gonal-f . 
the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a gonadotrophin-releasing of the hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after the beginning of treatment with a , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after two weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
65 experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use gonal-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy 
66 in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients with injecting yourself , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using a multidose presentation . 
gonal-f is at the making several injections , instructions unclear should be provided to avoid poor use of this multidose presentation . 
because of possible local reactions at the benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used for several consecutive days . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
67 suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
68 compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of the lower génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to the spc parentales ( e. g. age of the mother and the sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to the risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
the level of fsh are indicateurs endogenous failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients should répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
gonal-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of a syndrome of hyperstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is composed of folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced in cho cell ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the most important from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe lh , fsh and were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account of the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f is given concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already used in other sections of the spc . 
in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with the benzyl alcohol ( 0.9 ) or benzyl alcohol alone ( 0.9 ) caused a mild haemorrhage and inflammation subaiguë following subcutaneous injection and changes moderate type inflammatory or dégénératives after single intramuscular injection . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses 5 pharmacological of follitropine alfa ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at higher doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these findings were only a small clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
before the first use , the powder must be reconstituted with the solvent joint . 
gonal-f 300 iu / 0.50 ml ( 22 micrograms / 0.50 ml ) should not be reconstituted with other ampoules / vials of gonal-f . 
the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 iu to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of up to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a gonadotrophin-releasing of the hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after the beginning of treatment with a , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after two weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
76 experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
it is recommended not to use gonal-f when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy 
77 in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients with injecting yourself , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using a multidose presentation . 
gonal-f is at the making several injections , instructions unclear should be provided to avoid poor use of this multidose presentation . 
because of possible local reactions at the benzyl alcohol , the same site of injection should not be used for several consecutive days . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients treated for stimulate the growth folliculaire , in the treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
the precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires requires a physician experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
78 suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to that may be obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , high plasma levels of anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
79 compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of the lower génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to the spc parentales ( e. g. age of the mother and the sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to the risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
the level of fsh are indicateurs endogenous failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients should répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response to treatment . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
gonal-f should not be mixed in the same syringe with other medicinal products . 
pregnancy and lactation 
use during pregnancy 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
use during lactation 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of a syndrome of hyperstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is composed of folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced in cho cell ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the most important from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe lh , fsh and were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account of the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f is given concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , gonal-f is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of gonal-f given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of gonal-f , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , gonal-f have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already used in other sections of the spc . 
in rabbits , the formulation reconstituted with the benzyl alcohol ( 0.9 ) or benzyl alcohol alone ( 0.9 ) caused a mild haemorrhage and inflammation subaiguë following subcutaneous injection and changes moderate type inflammatory or dégénératives after single intramuscular injection . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses 5 pharmacological of follitropine alfa ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at higher doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these findings were only a small clinical relevance .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
86 the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a or the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after the beginning of treatment with a , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after two weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
87 experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients with injecting yourself , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to those obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
90 patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
96 the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a or the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after the beginning of treatment with a , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after two weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
97 experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients with injecting yourself , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to those obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
the following symptoms may be observed in sho severe ballonnement : abdominal pain , diarrhoea , hypertrophy ovarienne branded , weight gain , dyspnoea , oliguria , and gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
100 patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
anovulation ( including the polycystic ovarian syndrome , sopk ) in women who have not responded to treatment with the solvent clomifène . 
gonal-f , in combination with a preparation lutéinisante hormone ( lh ) , is recommended to stimulate the development folliculaire in women who have a severe deficiency of lh and fsh . 
in clinical trials , these patients were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l . 
gonal-f is used to stimulate the spermatogenèse in men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique , endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression , in combination with the choriogonadotropine human ( hcg ) . 
posology and method of administration 
any treatment with gonal-f should be institué under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems . 
gonal-f is administered subcutaneously . 
106 the recommended dose for gonal-f are consistent with those used in conjunction with the urinary fsh . 
clinical assessment of gonal-f indicates that daily doses , regimens and monitoring of therapy should not be different from those used commonly for preparations containing of the urinary fsh . 
however , when these doses were observed in a clinical study comparing gonal-f and urinary fsh , gonal-f was more effective than urinary fsh in terms of the total dose required lower and duration of treatment shorter , to achieve conditions pré-ovulatoires . 
the bioequivalence of doses equivalent packs monodose or multidose of gonal-f has been demonstrated . 
it is advisable complying , the recommended starting doses indicated below . 
patients anovulatoires ( including sopk ) : 
the aim of treatment with gonal-f is to develop a single follicule of of graaf mature rats from which the ovule will be libéré after administration of hcg . 
gonal-f may be prescribed by injection daily . 
in patients réglées , treatment should start within 7 days of cycle menstruel . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , based , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and / or estrogénique secretion . 
a standard treatment starts with 75 - 150 iu fsh daily and is increased preferably of 37,5 or 75 iu at 7 or preferably to 14 days apart , if necessary , to achieve an adequate , but not excessive response . 
the maximum daily dose of fsh must , in general , not to exceed 225 iu . 
if a patient has not response adequate after 4 weeks of treatment , this cycle should be abandonné and the patient recommencera treatment at a starting dose higher than in the cycle abandonné . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
patients entreprenant a stimulation ovarienne regard to obtain an folliculaire multipack before fécondation in vitro or other techniques medical assistance to the procreation : 
the treatment regimen for superovulation includes cause administration 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f daily , beginning the second or third day cycle . 
in general , development folliculaire should is achieved on average towards the tenth day ( 5 to 20 days ) . 
a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg is administered 24 at 48 hours after the last gonal-f injection to induce the final folliculaire maturation . 
the désensibilisation with a or the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is now commonly used to eliminate peak endogenous lh and the basal secretion of lh . 
in a schedule common , it will start the administration of gonal-f approximately 2 weeks after the beginning of treatment with a , both medicines being continued until healing growth folliculaire adequate . 
for example , it will give after two weeks of treatment with a , 150 to 225 iu of gonal-f during the first 7 days . 
the dose will then adjusted according to response ovarienne . 
107 experience pull the fiv shows that in general the success rates of treatment are stable for the first four attempts and gradually become less thereafter . 
patients anovulatoires due to a lack of severe lh and fsh : 
gonal-f should be administered by daily injections , at the same time as the lutropine alfa . 
these patients is aménorrhéiques and with a low endogenous oestrogen secretion of , treatment may be started at any time of the cycle . 
treatment should be individualised for the individual response of the individual patient , it is elucidated , but it also measured the size of follicule by ultrasound and estrogénique secretion . 
the recommended treatment starts with 75 iu lutropine alfa daily with 75 - 150 iu fsh . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
it may be appropriate in a cycle of prolong the stimulation up to 5 weeks . 
when an optimal response is obtained , a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hcg or 5.000 to 10,000 iu hcg should be given to 48 hours after the last injection of gonal-f and lutropine alfa . 
it is recommandera then to the patient to have a compared to others through sexual the same day and the day following the administration of hcg . 
alternatively , insémination intra-utérine ( iiu ) may be performed . 
a supportive phase lutéale may be considered ; , the lack of substances to lutéotrope activity ( lh / hcg ) after ovulation may lead to hepatic impairment yellow qualitative of the body . 
if an excessive response is obtained , treatment should be stopped and hcg should not be given . 
treatment should continue with the next cycle at a dosage of fsh lower than that of the cycle abandonné . 
men with hypogonadisme hypogonadotrophique : 
gonal-f should be administered at a dose of 150 iu three times a week , concomitantly with hcg , over not less than 4 months . 
if after this period , the patient has not responded to treatment combination , it may be continued ; the clinical experience indicates that there may be necessary to treat for at least 18 months to support a spermatogenèse . 
contraindications 
should not be used when an effective response cannot may not be achieved , for example : in women : primary ovarienne failure malformations of genitals incompatible with pregnancy fibrome hormonal intrauterine system incompatible with pregnancy in men : impairment testiculaire packaging 
special warnings and precautions for use 
gonal-f is a substance gonadotrope has may cause allergic reactions are mild to severe and should be used by physicians spécialistes in the management of problems with infertility . 
treatment with gonadotrophines application a certain the availability of the report physicians and professionals , as well as the appropriate use effective methods of follow-up . 
in women , a use well tolerated and effective use of gonal-f requires a periodic monitoring of the response ovarienne by examination échographique alone or preferably in combination with measurement of plasma levels of estradiol . 
the response to the administration of fsh may vary from patient to patient , some patients may have a weaker response . 
depending on the aim of treatment ( males and females ) , the effective dose to the lower should be used . 
the self-administration of gonal-f should be performed by patients motivés , formed and may place of avisés advice . 
during the formation of patients with injecting yourself , caution should be paid to the separate instructions for using the pen . 
the first injection of gonal-f should be given under direct medical supervision . 
patients with a porphyrie or who have a family history of porphyrie should be closely monitored during treatment with gonal-f . 
aggravation of a porphyrie or its occurrence may require discontinuation of treatment . 
gonal-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , and may therefore be considered as free of sodium . 
treatment in the female : 
before starting treatment , the couples infertiles should tests and possible contraindications for pregnancy should be recherchées . 
the sample porteront any especially on the hypothyroidism and insufficiency corticosurrénalienne , hyperprolactinémie and tumours hypophysaires or hypothalamiques for which specific treatment will be prescribed . 
patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire , as treatment of infertility anovulatoire or for techniques amp , may be at a hypertrophy or hyperstimulation ovarienne . 
the risk of developing these events will be minimisé if there is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored . 
for a precise interpretation of the indices of development and maturation folliculaires , the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the results tests conducted . 
clinical studies have shown that sensitivity to gonal-f ovarienne increased when used with the lutropine alfa . 
if an increase in the dose of fsh is needed , it is preferable to adjust the dose to intervals 7 and 14 days and increments of 37,5 or 75 iu . 
no clinical study comparing the combination prospectif gonal-f / lh with the human ménopausiques gonadotrophines ( hmg ) has been performed . 
comparison with historiques data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with gonal-f / lh is equivalent to those obtained with hmg . 
ovarienne of hyperstimulation syndrome ( sho ) 
the sho is a different from the hypertrophy ovarienne single . 
this syndrome may to varying degrees of severity . 
it also contains a hypertrophy ovarian , plasma levels 
109 high anabolic sexual and increased exposure in vascular permeability which can lead to an lungs within cavities péritonéale , pleurale and more rarely , péricardique . 
a clinical enzymes may relate : volume depletion , hémoconcentration , déséquilibres électrolytiques , ascites , hémopéritoine , pleural effusion , hydrothorax , acute respiratory distress and thromboembolic events . 
very rarely , sho severe may be accompanied complications such as pulmonary embolism , lesion ischaemic or myocardial infarction . 
a ovarienne excessive response to treatment with gonadotrophines causes rarely a sho without cases where the hcg is given to trigger ovulation . 
therefore it is taken , hyperstimulation ovarienne , eliminate the administration of hcg and conseiller to patients not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
a sho may develop rapidly ( 24 hours to several days ) into a potentially serious ; therefore , patients should be monitored for at least two weeks after the administration of hcg . 
in order to minimise the risk of sho or pregnancy multipack , it is recommended to échographiques and tests to measure the levels of estradiol . 
in patients anovulatoires , the risk of sho and pregnancy multipack is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 900 pg / ml ( 3.300 pmol / l ) , and more than 3 hair diameter &gt; or equal to 14 mm . 
with the techniques amp , the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne is increased to a plasma levels of estradiol &gt; 3.000 pg / ml ( 11.000 pmol / l ) and 20 hair or more of diameter &gt; or equal to 12 mm . 
when the levels of estradiol exceeds 5.500 pg / ml ( 20.200 pmol / l ) and / or that there is a total of 40 hair , or higher , it is recommended not to the administration of hcg . 
the risk of hyperstimulation ovarienne and pregnancy should be minimisé comprising if it is conforme at the recommended dose of gonal-f , schedule and if treatment is closely monitored ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . 
in the techniques amp , draining of all hair , before ovulation , may reduce the risk of a hyperstimulation . 
a sho may be more severe and last longer in the event of pregnancy . 
the most frequently , sho occur following discontinuation of treatment hormonal and reaches its maximum between the higher and the day 10 following treatment . 
in general , the sho régresse spontaneously with the development of your period . 
in case of severe sho , arrêtera treatment with gonadotrophines still ongoing , the patient will be hospitalisée and specific treatment of sho should be started . 
the incidence of this syndrome is higher in patients with poor ovarian polykystiques . 
pregnancy multipacks 
multiple pregnancies patients , especially with high rang , are increased risk of complications maternal and périnatales . 
compared to a family neutralization , the risk of pregnancy multipack is higher in patients entreprenant an induction of ovulation with gonal-f . 
the majority of these are gémellaires multiple pregnancies . 
in order to minimize the risk of pregnancy multipack , close monitoring of the response ovarienne is recommended . 
in patients entreprenant aseptic of amp , the risk of pregnancy multipack is mainly bound to the number of embryons transférés , with their quality , and to the age of the patient . 
110 patients should be aware of the possible risk of pregnancy multipack before the start of treatment . 
fausse-couche 
the risk of spontaneous fausse-couche is higher in patients entreprenant a stimulate the growth folliculaire to induce ovulation or in the setting of techniques amp than in the general population . 
pregnancy ectopique 
women who have a history of a condition tubaire are at risk of pregnancy ectopique , that pregnancy has been obtained spontaneously or in regimens for infertility treatment . 
the prevalence reported pregnancy ectopique after fiv is 2 to 5 against 1 1.5 in the general population . 
tumour of the lower génital 
cases of tumours ovarian or tract génital , benign and malignant , have been reported in women who received the combination of medicines to treat infertility . 
it is not known if treatment with gonadotrophines baseline influence the risk of these tumours in patients infertiles . 
teratogenicity following exposure to 
the prevalence of malformations defects may be slightly higher after amp after spontaneous family . 
it is suggested that this is due to the spc parentales ( e. g. age of the mother and the sperm characteristics ) and a different in amp multiple pregnancies . 
thromboembolic events 
in women with risk factors for thromboembolic events generally assumed , as a personal or family history , treatment with gonadotrophines may to increase the risk of . 
in these women , it is necessary to measure the benefit of the administration of gonadotrophines compared to the risks . 
it should be noted , however , that pregnancy itself leads to an increased risk for thromboembolic events . 
treatment in men : 
the level of fsh are indicateurs endogenous failure testiculaire packaging . 
such patients should répondront not to treatment with gonal-f / hcg . 
a pooled analysis of sperm is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment , as part of the response . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products have been reported during treatment with gonal-f . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there is no indication of gonal-f during pregnancy . 
no teratogenic risk has been reported , following controlled ovarienne hyperstimulation , in clinical use of gonadotrophines . 
in case of exposure during pregnancy , clinical data are insufficient to teratogenic effect of recombinant hfsh . 
however , to date , no effect of malformation has been reported . 
no teratogenic effects were observed in animal studies . 
gonal-f is not indicated during breast-feeding . 
during breast-feeding , prolactin secretion may reduce the rate of a stimulation ovarienne . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
the effects of overdose with gonal-f are not known , however , the possibility of occurrence of a syndrome of hyperstimulation ovarienne cannot be excluded ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pharmacological properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : gonadotrophines , atc code : 
gonal-f is composed of folliculo-stimulante hormone ( fsh ) produced in cho cell ( chinese hamster ovary ) genetically modified . 
in women , the most important from a parenteral administration of fsh is the development of hair of of graaf mature . 
in clinical trials , patients with severe lh , fsh and were defined by a plasma levels of lh , endogenous &lt; 1.2 iu / l ( measured by strength centralisé ) . 
however , it should be taken into account of the blood changes inter-laboratoires for measurement of lh . 
in men deficient in fsh , gonal-f is given concomitantly with hcg for 4 months minimum , induces the spermatogenèse . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
following intravenous administration , the follitropine alfa is distributed in the stools extracellular with an initial half-life of approximately 2 hours , and eliminated with a final half-life of approximately 24 hours . 
the volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance are by 10 l and 0.6 l / h . 
a eighth of the dose of follitropine alfa given is excreted in urine . 
after subcutaneous administration , the absolute bioavailability is about 70 . 
after repeated administration of follitropine alfa , steady state is reached in 3 to 4 days with the accumulation of approximately 3 . 
in women for where the secretion of gonadotrophines endogènes is taken , the follitropine alfa have however shown its ability to stimulate the development folliculaire and stéroïdogenèse , despite levels of lh , measurable . 
preclinical safety data 
non-clinical data from conventional studies of single and repeated and genotoxicity have revealed no special hazard for humans other than those already used in other sections of the spc . 
a disease of fertility has been reported in rats at doses 5 pharmacological of follitropine alfa ( &gt; 40 iu / kg / day ) over prolonged periods , include fécondité more reduced . 
at higher doses ( &gt; 5 iu / kg / day ) , the follitropine alfa reduces the number of foetuses viables without teratogenic effect , and ensures a percentage of dystocies identical to that observed with hmg species urinary . 
however , since gonal-f is not indicated during pregnancy , these findings were only a small clinical relevance .

treatment with gonal-f consistently rarely a sho severe , unless the medicine used to trigger maturation final folliculaire ( containing the choriogonadotropine humaine- hcg ) has been given . 
therefore , in case of sho , it is recommended not to administer the hcg and do not have of compared to others through sexual or to use effective methods oral mécaniques for at least 4 days . 
the occurrence of a pregnancy multipack after you have had support the assistance prescription to the procreation is related to the number of ovocytes / embryons transférés . 
in patients receiving treatment of induction of ovulation , the number of multiple pregnancies and naissances is increased , compared to the natural family . 
however , this risk can be reduced by using the dose and schedule of administration recommended .

the effects of the vaccine were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans . 
the main study of the vaccine enrolling 400 adult healthy and had to compare the ability of different doses of vaccine , with or without the adjuvant &apos; , to trigger the production of antibodies ( immunogenicity ) . 
the participants received two injections of vaccine containing one of four different doses of haemagglutinine . 
the injections have been performed to 21 days apart . 
the main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies anti-grippe in the blood of patients with three find distincts : before vaccination , the day of the second injection ( day 21 ) and 21 days later ( day 42 ) .

the main study showed that the vaccine measured to 3.75 micrograms haemagglutinine with an add-on to produced an antibody response that met the criteria . 
in 21e day after the second injection , 84 of the people receiving the vaccine had levels of antibodies that would protect against the h5n1 . 
what is the risk associated with the use of the vaccine ? 
for the full list of all side effects reported with the vaccine , see the package leaflet . 
it is recommended to see vaccination for people with a brusque a fever . 
why has vaccine been approved ? 
the chmp decided that the benefits of prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for active immunisation against subtype h5n1 of flu virus a. 
the committee recommended that the vaccine be given marketing authorisation holder . 
other information about to the vaccine : 
the european commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the european union for prepandemic influenza vaccine ( h5n1 ) ( split virion , inactivated , adjuvanted ) glaxosmithkline biologicals to glaxosmithkline biologicals s. a. on 26 september 2008 .

information from clinical data non-cliniques : 
the ability of the vaccine to induce protection against the homologous and heterologous strains of the vaccine has been evaluated in pré-clinique with inoculations of a ( challenge ) in the furet . 
in each experience , four groups six ferrets were immunisés intramuscularly with a vaccine adjuvanté with as03 containing hémagglutinine dérivée the h5n1 strain / a / vietnam / 1194 / 004 ( nibrg-14 ) . 
doses of 15- 5 - 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms hémagglutinine has been tested in experience similar , and doses of 15- 7,5- 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms hémagglutinine has been tested in the experience in the heterologous challenge . 
the controls have included a immunisés with an add-on to alone , the vaccine non-adjuvanté ( 15 micrograms of ha ) or with saline solution tamponnée of sodium . 
ferrets were vaccinated to j0 and j21 and exposure by route intratrachéale to j49 at a dose létale of h5n1 / a / vietnam / 1194 / 004 or h5n1 / has / indonesia / 5 / 05 showing . 
among those receiving the vaccine adjuvanté , respectively 87 and 96 were applied to the dose létale transfusions or showing . 
the excretion viral in the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in animals were vaccinated compared to controls , suggesting a reduction of the risk of transmission viral .

what is hbvaxpro ? 
hbvaxpro is a vaccine , available as a suspension for injection in vials and pre-filled syringes . 
it contains some parts of the hepatitis b virus as the active substance . 
hbvaxpro is available as two concentrations ( 10 to 40 micrograms / ml ) . 
what is hbvaxpro used for ? 
hbvaxpro is used for vaccination against hepatitis b people with a risk of exposure to hepatitis b virus , such as assessed on the basis of official recommendations . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how to hbvaxpro used for ? 
a course must include at least three injections of hbvaxpro . 
the recommended dose for children up to age of 15 years of age is 0.5 ml of concentrate the lower ( 10 g / ml ) with each injection . 
for adults and adolescents aged 16 years or older , 1 ml of concentrate the lower is used for each injection . 
the concentration the higher ( 40 micrograms / ml ) is used in patients who are or are receiving dialysis ( undergoing a blood clearance technique ) . 
hbvaxpro is usually given by injection into a muscle of the thigh in infants and young children and shoulder in children , adolescents and adults . 
the schedule of injections depends on the age of the patient , the strength of the immune system response to vaccination and the probability of exposure to the hepatitis b infection . 
for a full list of comparison administration , see the summary of product characteristics ( also part of the epar ) . 
how to hbvaxpro expected to work ? 
hbvaxpro is a vaccine . 
vaccines work by apprenant to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against a disease . 
hbvaxpro contains small amounts of surface antigens ( proteins from the surface ) of the hepatitis b virus . 
if someone receives the vaccine , the immune system recognises the surface antigens as étrangers and produces antibodies against them . 
the immune system will then 
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. able to produce antibodies more quickly when people will be exposed to the naturally viruses . 
this helps to protect you against infection with hepatitis b infection . 
this means that they are fixés on the intermediate aluminium to induce a better response . 
hbvaxpro has been developed specifically from a vaccine already used in the european union , to remove the preservative thiomersal , which contains of mercury &apos; . 
a exposure repeated at mercury &apos; from sources as medicinal products and food may lead to its in the organs . 
this accumulation may be harmful and is a cause of concern . 
how has hbvaxpro been studied ? 
as the active substance in hbvaxpro is already authorised in the european union , hbvaxpro has not been studied formelles . 
the company has supplied information on the comparison of other vaccines with and without thiomersal , including studies involving a vaccine that contains the active ingredient that hbvaxpro . 
what benefit has demonstrated by hbvaxpro during the studies ? 
the results of studies presented have shown that vaccines exempts thiomersal induisaient of protective levels of antibodies against hepatitis b virus similar to those induced by vaccines containing thiomersal at the end of the vaccination schedule . 
among these vaccines figuraient those contenaient the same active substance that hbvaxpro . 
what is the risk associated with the use of hbvaxpro ? 
the most common side effects seen with hbvaxpro ( in 1 to 10 users in 100 ) are reactions at the site of injection including pain , temporary , erythema ( redness ) and a induration ( durcissement ) . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with hbvaxpro , see the package leaflet . 
hbvaxpro should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to the active substance or to any of the other ingredients . 
it must not be used in people who have a fever . 
as with all vaccines , if hbvaxpro is used in grands prématurés , there is a risk of apnoea ( short pauses the respiratory ) in infants . 
their respiratory should be monitored for 3 days after vaccination . 
why has hbvaxpro been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) concluded that suppression thiomersal vaccines do reduced not their effectiveness in protection against infection with hepatitis b virus , but reduce their risk . 
the committee recommended that one of the marketing authorisation holder for hbvaxpro . 
other information about : 
the european commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the european union for hbvaxpro to sanofi pasteur msd snc on 27 april 2001 . 
the marketing authorisation was renewed on 27 april 2006 .

medicinal product to the erythropoietins yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae ( strain 2150-2-3 ) . 
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 
pharmaceutical form 
suspension for injection slightly opaque , white suspension . 
clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
the risk to be vaccinated are determined on the basis of official recommendations . 
it may be expected to vaccination with hbvaxpro confers protection also against hepatitis d as hepatitis d ( caused by the delta agent ) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis b infection . 
posology and method of administration 
posology children and adolescents ( being born until the age of 15 years of age ) : 
1 dose ( 5 g ) of 0.5 ml solution for each injection should be used . 
primary vaccination : 
regimen must include at least three injections . 
the two regimens of primary vaccination may be recommended : 
0 , 1 , 6 month : two injections of one month apart , followed by a third dose six months after the first injection . 
0 , 1 , 2 , 12 months : three injections to one month apart , followed by a fourth dose 12 months after the first injection . 
2 it is recommended to administer the vaccine in any regimens listed . 
infants receiving the schedule at range short ( 0 , 1 , 2 months ) should receive a booster dose at 12 months , to achieve high levels of antibodies . 
a booster dose : 
subjects immunocompétents 
the need for a booster dose in immunocompetent individuals who have had a complete primary immunisation course has not been established . 
however , some forms of vaccination local marked currently a recommendation for a booster dose and they must be respectés . 
individuals with immunodeficiency ( e. g. patients on dialysis , subjects following ) 
in subjects with vaccinated , additional doses of vaccine should be recommended if the potency of antibodies against hepatitis b surface antigen of hepatitis b virus ( anti-aghbs ) is less than 10 iu / l . 
revaccination subjects non-répondeurs 
when patients non-répondeurs after the primary vaccination are revaccinés , 15-25 of them produce an antibody response satisfactorily after administration of an additional dose and 30-50 after the administration of three doses . 
however , due to insufficient data on safety of the vaccine hepatitis b when the number of doses administered excède the number of recommended doses , the revaccination of subjects who have had a complete primary vaccination is not systematically recommended . 
the revaccination should be considered for those at high risk , after assessed the benefit from the vaccination and the potential risks of an increase of side effects local and disorders . 
special recommendations : 
recommendations for infants whose mothers have taken mothers porteuses of hepatitis b virus 
- at the tacrolimus , an injection of immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b ( within 24 hours ) . 
it can be 
given the tacrolimus , at the same time as the injection of immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b , but with an injection site séparé . 
- subsequent vaccine should be given according to guidelines 
local of vaccination . 
recommendations for exposure known or présumée to hepatitis b virus ( e. g. pricking with a needle contaminated by sewage ) : 
- administration immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b as soon as possible after exposure ( in the 24 
- the injection with a first dose of vaccine should be administered within 7 days of exposure . 
it may be given at the same time as the injection of immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b , but with an injection site séparé . 
- monitoring sérologique is also recommended , with subsequent injections of the vaccine . 
necessary ( i. e. the status sérologique ) , the patient for a short and protection . 
- in patients who are not vaccinées or incomplètement vaccinées , injections additional 
should be made according to the initial vaccination recommended . 
the schedule accelerated including the booster vaccination at 12 months may be supplied . 
3 method of administration the vaccine should be carried out by intramuscular injection . 
in neonates and infants , the injection should be used in the upper préférentiellement antéro-latérale of the thigh . 
in children and adolescents , the injection should be used preferably in the deltoid muscle . 
do not be administered intravascularly . 
exceptionally , the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders . 
see section 6.6 for instructions on preparation . 
contraindications 
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients 
- severe fébriles infections 
special warnings and precautions for use 
since the long incubation period of hepatitis b , it is possible that the infection is not diagnosed is present at the time of vaccination . 
in such cases , as vaccination may not prevents not infection with hepatitis b infection . 
the vaccine will not prevent infection caused by the virus hepatitis a , hepatitis c and hepatitis e or other agents pathogènes known to infect others the liver . 
as with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment should always be immediately available , because of rare anaphylactic reactions occurring after the administration of the vaccine . 
the vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and thiocyanate potassium used during the holder of the vaccine . 
therefore , hypersensitivity reactions may occur . 
in view of the benefit high of vaccination , in these infants , the administration should not be discontinued or reportée . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
the vaccine may be given : 
- with immunoglobulins anti-hépatite b , use one injection site séparé . 
- to complete the primary vaccination or be used as a booster dose in subjects who received at 
past another vaccine against hepatitis b. 
- in combination with other vaccines using injection sites séparés and pre-filled syringes 
concomitant administration of vaccine pneumococcique conjugate ( prevenar ) with a hepatitis b vaccine using pictures 0 , 1 , 6 months and 0 , 1 , 2 , 12 months , has not been sufficiently studied .

micrograms adsorbed on aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate of amorphe ( 0.50 milligram al-blister ) 
medicinal product to the erythropoietins yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae ( strain 2150-2-3 ) . 
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 
pharmaceutical form 
suspension for injection slightly opaque , white suspension . 
clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
the risk immunisés are to be determined on the basis of official recommendations . 
it may be expected to vaccination with hbvaxpro confers protection also against hepatitis d as hepatitis d ( caused by the delta agent ) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis b infection . 
posology and method of administration 
dosage in adults and adolescents ( from the age of 16 years ) : 
1 dose ( 10 g ) of 1 ml for each injection should be used . 
primary vaccination : 
regimen must include at least three injections . 
the two regimens of primary vaccination may be recommended : 
0 , 1 , 6 month : two injections of one month apart , followed by a third dose six months after the first injection . 
0 , 1 , 2 , 12 months : three injections to one month apart , followed by a fourth dose 12 months after the first injection . 
16 it is recommended to administer the vaccine in any regimens listed . 
the people receiving the schedule at range short ( 0 , 1 , 2 months ) should receive a booster dose at 12 months , to achieve high levels of antibodies . 
a booster dose : 
subjects immunocompétents 
the need for a booster dose in immunocompetent individuals who have had a complete primary immunisation course has not been established . 
however , some forms of vaccination local marked currently a recommendation for a booster dose and they must be respectés . 
individuals with immunodeficiency ( e. g. patients on dialysis , transplant organ ) 
in subjects with vaccinated , additional doses of vaccine should be recommended if the potency of antibodies against hepatitis b surface antigen of hepatitis b virus ( anti-aghbs ) is less than 10 iu / l . 
revaccination subjects non-répondeurs 
when patients non-répondeurs after the primary vaccination are revaccinés , 15-25 of them produce an antibody response satisfactorily after administration of an additional dose and 30-50 after the administration of three doses . 
however , due to insufficient data on safety of the vaccine hepatitis b when the number of doses administered excède the number of recommended doses , the revaccination of subjects who have had a complete primary vaccination is not systematically recommended . 
the revaccination should be considered for those at high risk , after assessed the benefit from the vaccination and the potential risks of an increase of side effects local and disorders . 
special exposure recommendations for known or présumée to hepatitis b virus ( e. g. pricking with a needle contaminated by sewage ) : 
- administration immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b as soon as possible after exposure ( in the 24 
hours ) . 
- the injection with a first dose of vaccine should be administered within 7 days of exposure . 
it may be given at the same time as the injection of immunoglobulin anti-hépatite b , but with an injection site séparé . 
- monitoring sérologique is also recommended , with subsequent injections of the vaccine . 
necessary ( i. e. the status sérologique of the patient ) for a short and protection . 
- in patients who are not vaccinées or incomplètement vaccinées , injections additional 
should be made according to the initial vaccination recommended . 
the schedule accelerated including the booster vaccination at 12 months may be supplied . 
method of administration the vaccine should be carried out by intramuscular injection . 
do not be administered intravascularly . 
exceptionally , the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders . 
see section 6.6 for instructions on preparation . 
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients 
- severe fébriles infections 
special warnings and precautions for use 
since the long incubation period of hepatitis b , it is possible that the infection is not diagnosed is present at the time of vaccination . 
in such cases , as vaccination may not prevents not infection with hepatitis b infection . 
some factors may reduce the immune response to hepatitis b vaccines 
these factors include age , male genre , obesity , tabac , the route of administration , and some conditions sous-jacentes . 
monitoring sérologique should be considered in patients who for which it is a risk of do not reaching the level of seroprotection following primovaccination complete . 
additional doses may be considered in people who respond little or no to vaccination . 
the vaccine will not prevent infection caused by the virus hepatitis a , hepatitis c and hepatitis e or other agents pathogènes known to infect others the liver . 
as with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment should always be immediately available , because of rare anaphylactic reactions occurring after the administration of the vaccine . 
the vaccine may contain traces of formaldehyde and thiocyanate potassium used during the holder of the vaccine . 
therefore , hypersensitivity reactions may occur . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
the vaccine may be given : 
- with anti-hépatite b immunoglobulins , in one injection site séparé . 
- to complete the primary vaccination or be used as a booster dose in subjects who received at 
past another vaccine against hepatitis b. 
- in combination with other vaccines using injection sites séparés and pre-filled syringes 
pregnancy and lactation 
for the surface antigen of hepatitis b virus ( aghbs ) , there are no data on the use in pregnant women . 
however , as with all vaccines viraux inactivated , it should not be expected to be of the side effects in the foetus . 
use during pregnancy is is recommended that if the benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus . 
hbvaxpro should be used with caution in pregnant women . 
the effect of this vaccine during breast-feeding has not been studied ; no contre-indication has been established . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
however , 57 of the rare side effects listed in section &quot; side effects &quot; may impair the ability to drive or use machines . 
undesirable effects 
the following adverse reactions have been reported after a wide use of the vaccine .

findings scientifiques and on the changes of the marketing authorisation holder of hbvaxpro presented by the emea 
hbvaxpro is a vaccine monovalent shown at the site for active immunisation against infection caused by all known subtypes of the hepatitis b virus , in all groups âges presented at risk of exposure to the virus . 
the active substance in hbvaxpro , ( recombinant ) vaccine against hepatitis b surface antigen , is of hepatitis b virus ( aghbs ) , purified and technology . 
hbvaxpro is a vaccine which induces a specific antibody and cell immune response against the aghbs , resulting in a active immunisation against infection caused by the hepatitis b infection . 
the benefits of hbvaxpro are protection effective against hepatitis b in all groups âges in the absence of thimérosal in the product fini . 
problems related to the relatively low immunogenicity component hepatitis b ( hepb ) in vaccines contains the ingredient recombinant hepatitis b produced by spmsd have been evaluated and extensively débattus by the chmp and its groups of physical work ( biotechnology , vaccines ) . 
the 26 may 2005 , the chmp decided provided réunir a group of experts &apos;assessment ad hoc on protection short-term and long-term against hepatitis conférée by vaccines encoding against hepatitis b. 
the chmp was interroge on that there is a variability shown response in antibodies against hepatitis b not anticipated after vaccination with hexavac . 
this variability appears to be related to changes currently not contrôlables of process holder component of the vaccine technology hepb . 
the low concerns portaient on the immunogenicity of the ingredients of hexavac hepb , the consequences possible on protection long-term against infection with hepatitis b and vaccination of booster dose after primary vaccination course with this vaccine . 
during the réunion plénière of january 2006 , the chmp confirmed its concern regarding the decrease in the immunogenicity of the ingredients technology hep b in hbvaxpro and procomvax . 
the committee discuté the current of connaissances on the clinical relevance of the finding and immunological memory usually and decided that these problems scrupuleusement had to be performed prior to administration of measure from bottle . 
the committee also seen with the final study in infants less than 1 year has been performed in 2001 . 
therefore , the data up to date should be interpreted with caution because they applies to a paediatric dose ( 5 g ) of the vaccine hep b product before 2001 . 
it semblerait that the vaccine hep b currently product is less immunogène that the medicinal product in the prograf / prograft . 
the reason of the decrease in the immunogenicity for several years have not yet been identified . 
it has been shown to be decided that would be taken on the basis of the responses eaten to questions about quality and clinical concern . 
13 february 2006 , the european commission ( this ) was an open- label study the procedure formulated with article 20 of règlement ( ) n 726 / 2004 , the chmp has expressed its concern regarding the low immunogenicity of the ingredients of hbvaxpro hepb . 
1 discussion 
from the quality , there are no outil technique , analytique or animal able to predict the immunogenicity of the ingredients of encoding hepb in humans . 
any tools analytiques may be used as criteria cohérence , but not as corrélats for the safety and efficacy ( immunogenicity ) batch release hepb produced by spmsd . 
however , the new model supplied only and it is no p-value prévision before you have been completely validated and after shown its ability to to the coagulation of hbvaxpro who achieved a immune response high of those who achieved a immune response low during clinical trials . 
although the mechanism first of the decrease in the immunogenicity during the 5 years is not yet clarified , it has been prouvé that of the manufacturing process , which was now better evaluated . 
the tamm was found at the site a process holder improved in order to increase the immunogenicity . 
among data investigated by the chmp figuraient those 7 studies hbvaxpro and procomvax , a is still ongoing . 
these studies have been carried out on a groups at risk and âges groups including children neonates are of mothers positives to hepatitis b , infants , in healthy young adults and in subjects aged 16 to 35 years of age . 
in clinical studies conducted with the tamm to date on hbvaxpro and procomvax , clinical seroprotection were achieved in the high majority of vaccinated . 
no evidence of impact on the cap short or long-term has been identified . 
in addition , a study of performance clinical assessed by protection against the disease , such as usual the trial v121-018 , support that vaccines against hepatitis b are effective to reduce the infection with hepatitis b and its serious sequelae . 
due to the relatively high risk of infection , the group of infants neonates are of mothers positives to hepatitis b is the most vulnérable to a immunogenicity inadequate possible of the vaccine . 
as there are currently no compared to an increase in the number of cases acute hepatitis b after vaccination with hbvaxpro , because of the fact that the eu is an area lower right away endémique , no problem safety has been identified by the chmp . 
the results of these trials on the product made in the current facilities confirm of solid performance and reproductibles fondées on these data historiques récentes and allow also consider of performance comparable among other populations . 
in clinical expériences spent , a high performance obtained in adolescents and young adults was still been accompanied by a high performance in infants . 
therefore , the results of this study prouvent that the medicinal product currently available procure the right protective levels of antibodies in all populations for which it is used . 
the chmp was entendu with tamm on the révision information about to the medicinal product for all formulations of hbvaxpro , to be possible advice and suggestions émis during the procedure . 
the spc and the package leaflets révisés gave information to day on the better use of the medicinal product , because of monthly data . 
these changes in the , respond to the questions soulevées by the chmp and its groups of physical work . 
the decision of the results of studies , the tamm was committed to change the sections 4.2 , 4.4 and 4.5 ( as appropriate ) and 5.1 of the spc as follows : 
the chmp was studied in list every techniques and clinical data are available for hbvaxpro . 
the chmp concluded that the use of this vaccine does not require immediate had risk , the target for which the vaccine is indicated . 
the potential risks restants will be reduced to acceptable by the rpc révisé in depth . 
information will be transmises medical or healthcare professionals and assureront the correct use of the vaccine in the different groups of âges and categories at risk . 
the committee avalisé the new information on preparation and convenu of clore the procedure formulated with article 20 without as bottle other . 
3 on the changes of the marketing authorisation holder of hbvaxpro 
considérant that 
the chmp thinks that information on the product should be affected by hbvaxpro to make sure the sûreté and efficacy of the clinical use for the following reasons : 
because of data on the low immunogenicity available to date , the chmp decided that it is necessary to give other studies to make sure to the avenir , protection long-term against hepatitis b vaccine with the current ; 
the use of this vaccine does not require immediate risk , the target for which the vaccine is indicated . 
the potential risks restants will be minimisés to acceptable by changes in depth of rpc ; 
the chmp decided that balance of hbvaxpro for protection against infection caused by all known subtypes of the hepatitis b virus , in all groups âges presented at risk of exposure to the virus , remains favourable . 
the committee recommended that the marketing authorisation holder for hbvaxpro per affected , in accordance with article 5 , section 2 , the règlement ( ) n 726 / 2004 .

what is helicobacter test infai ? 
helicobacter test infai is a modified diagnosis . 
it is supplied in a pot containing a powder that is made up into an oral solution . 
the powder is made up of the active substance urea 13c ( 45 mg for children or 75 mg for adults ) . 
what is helicobacter test infai used for ? 
helicobacter test infai is used in the diagnosis of infection of the stomach and duodénum ( part of the gut just below the stomach ) induced helicobacter pylori . 
pylori is a bacterium which intervient as factor in diseases such as the dyspepsia ( heartburn , distension and nausea ) , the gastritis ( inflammation of the stomach ) and peptic ulcer ( ulcers of the stomach or duodénum ) . 
helicobacter test infai can be used to testing in adults , adolescents may be with peptic ulcer and children from 3 to 11 years of age . 
it can not be used in children when tests invasifs ( to a sample stomach using tube ) cannot be performed , or were ambigus , or to check that h . 
pylori has been removed after specific treatment for éradiquer infection . 
how to helicobacter test infai used for ? 
helicobacter test infai is a modified breathing : samples air expiré are collected then envoyés for analysis at a laboratory experienced . 
to perform the , the patient should take four , two before taking helicobacter test infai and two after . 
the patient should jeûner for at least 6 hours before the , preferably at . 
first , the patient prélève two samples air expiré , using tubular or liquid provided with helicobacter infai test . 
the patient is then one of a meal ( corresponding to 200 ml pur orange juice , either 1 g of citric acid diluted in 200 ml of water ) , and the solution powder helicobacter test infai diluted water . 
finally , 30 minutes after bu the solution , the patient prélève two new samples air expiré . 
in children aged three to 11 years , the meal of a should consist 100 ml of pur orange juice . 
for more information on the way is déroule this assay , see the package leaflet . 
pylori in titanium carbon that also contains 13c . 
this titanium carbon administration may be measured by laboratoires spécialisés using an called spectrométrie of mass . 
if there is no titanium carbon administration in the air expiré , it may reached to a lack of bacteria in the stomach or duodénum . 
how has been conducted with helicobacter test infai ? 
helicobacter test infai has been tested in four studies in adults involving a total of 561 patients and a study on 335 children and adolescents . 
all patients received 75 mg urea 13c , except allergic children aged less than 11 years of age who received 45 mg . 
one of the studies in adults has been performed in patients who received before antibiotics to treat their infection . 
what benefit has demonstrated by helicobacter infai test during the studies ? 
in all studies , the results of the test used using helicobacter test infai concentrations were consistent with the results with the endoscopie and in more than 95 cases . 
what is the risk associated with the use of helicobacter test infai ? 
there are no known adverse events associated with this assay . 
however , if the patient vomit during the , treatment should be recommencé , but not prior to the next .

the tubes containing blood samples must be envoyés in the original package in order to a laboratory qualified for analysis . 
analysis of samples respiratory and specification of test for laboratoires 
samples tubes respiratory recueillis in the blood in the glass and plastic 10 ml were analysed by the proportion of isotopique by spectrométrie mass ( imrs ) . 
analysis of the proportion of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase part of the package for diagnostic helicobacter infai test . 
the exactitude of test is intimement related to the quality of the analysis breathing . 
the specification of spectromètre of mass parameters such as the linearity , stability ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for exactitude nervous system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis was conducted with laboratoires qualifiés . 
the precise methodology validée for this use are as follows : 
preparation of the sample for irms 
to determine the proportion 13c / 12c of the gas anhydrase the respiratory by mass spectrométrie of the gas anhydrase should be isolated from the sample breathing and introduit in the spectromètre of mass . 
the automatic for the preparation of mass spectromètres isotopiques used for the analysis of the test breathing is based on a recombinant séparation by chromatographie do to flow continued . 
the water is extracted from the sample using a piège to water nafion or with the preparation of chromatographie do that sépare each gas in a column of chromatographie do with the hélium as éluant . 
moving into the column , all types of gas respiratory were detected with a détecteur ionique . 
the amount of gas anhydrase , identified by the time of retention characteristic , is inserted into the spectromètre of mass . 
analysis of by spectrométrie mass 
for analyser the gas anhydrase isolated from the sample , its molecule should be ionisée , beam , accélérée by a champ électrique , déviée by a champ resonance imaging and finalement detected . 
these five steps if effectuent in the analyseur a mass spectromètre of which is represented three parts divided : the source , the tube and the disposal unit . 
the ionisation , the formation of beam and detection are given in the disposal unit . 
introduction the sample 
there is to put the gas anhydrase in the analyseur , several organ introduction . 
for the analysis of the test breathing , équilibrage assessment of the gas anhydrase of sample with a reference gas standard is essential . 
this provided high exactitude to this system , when the calculation of the contents of the gas anhydrase isotopique is achieved by compared to a standard indépendant . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of test breathing is based on the administration of urea specifically étiquetée 13c whose metabolism is follow-up , but it also measured the 13co2 in the gas respiratory expirés . 
6 the spectromètre of mass should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum 3 analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation . 
safe opportunity : 
upon storage of parameters surgery and on the results with the opportunity protected to avoid manipulations effect . 
proportion of 13c / 12c with the pdb ( pee dee beliminate ) . 
boucle of sample : 
&lt; 200 l ; 
tests to check the specification are linearity , stability ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures . 
all spectromètres of mass for analysis of the respiratory should respond to the following specification : 
0.5 for samples respiratory including the concentration of linearity : 
co2 ranges from 1 to 7 . 0.2 on 10 pulses after stability : 0.3 for 13c in abondance neutralization using a tube of measure : respiratory 10 ml with a concentration of 3 of co2 breathing . 
there is an infection at helicobacter pylori if the difference between the proportion of 13c / 12c at baseline and to 30 minutes is greater than 4 . 
the measures properly evaluated may be used with laboratoires objectivement qualifiés .

analysis of the proportion of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase part of the package for diagnosis helicobacter infai test . 
the exactitude of test is intimement related to the quality of the respiratory analysis . 
the specification in some of the analysis breathing such as the linearity , stability ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for exactitude nervous system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis was conducted with laboratoires qualifiés . 
it is recommended to perform the analysis , as soon as possible after collect the samples ) , and in no case after 4 weeks . 
the precise methodology validée for this use are as follows : 
preparation of samples for analysis spectrométrique infrarouge ( ndir ) 
the rate of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase samples respiratory is determined directly into the gas breathing expiré . 
the gas breathing within tubes is introduit in the spectromètre ndir in pump gas . 
the content of water respiratory sample is maintained about consistent with a piège to water nafion . 
the pens free of co2 ( gas ) to the reference étalonnage and to the measurement is made using an absorbeur of co2 intégré to analyseur . 
analysis spectrométrique infrarouge 
for analyser the gas anhydrase content of the gas breathing , a rayonnement wide band émis by a source infrarouge is dirigé turn to all into the chamber to measure and into the chamber to a hâcheur of beam . 
it is used for détecteurs of transmission to double layer with a chamber before and chamber back syringes each one of the gas isotopiquement purs to measure respectively ( 13co2 and 12co2 ) . 
in the chamber to measure the rayonnement infrarouge is affaibli by the component gazeux to measure which perturbe balance between the beam to measure and the reference beam . 
a fluctuation of temperature occurs and results in a fluctuation the pressure in the chamber before of détecteur infrarouge . 
a condensateur membrane relié to this chamber and exposed to a 
an increase in introduction semi-automatique are given the gas of measure in amounts assessed in the reference gas circulating in the circuit of spectromètre infrarouge . 
this helps to measure the 13c / 12c all concentrations of co2 above 1 . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of test breathing is based on the oral dose of urea étiquetée 13c whose is followed by enzymatic hydrolysis , but it also measured by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive the 13co2 in the gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètres infrarouges for gas respiratory should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum three analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation safe opportunity : 
upon storage of parameters surgery and on the results with the opportunity protected to avoid further manipulations 
to ensure the specification , tests linearity , stability and précision measures should be performed . 
dose adjustment of the site zero of détecteurs , using the reference gas généré by the spectromètre . 
there is an infection at helicobacter pylori if the difference between the proportion of 13c / 12c at baseline and established after 30 minutes is greater than 4.0 . 
the measures properly evaluated may be used with laboratoires objectivement qualifiés .

it is recommended to test for the patient position rest . 
the modified with collect samples to determine the from baseline ( baseline 00- minutes ) . 
take the paille and tubes extraction involving the label : &quot; time extraction ( baseline 00-minutes ) &quot; and remove the package of the test . 
remove the stopper with an tubular of prélèvem ent , and put the paille previously déballée in the tube . 
then souffler gently into the tube until the surface intérieure of tube either embuée . 
any in well-being to souffler , remove the paille and refermer immediately the tube with the stopper . 
the second tube extraction ( label : &quot; time blood baseline 00-minutes &quot; ) : 
in procédant in the same way . 
then drink without wait until all 100 ml of concentrate orange juice ( 100 ) . 
then prepare the solution in the modified proceed as follows : 
remove the pot étiqueté &quot; powder of 13c-urée &quot; of the package of test , the open and the filling to 3 / 4 of tap water . 
fermer the pot and shake carefully until all the powder . 
measure the contents in a glass . 
( the total volume of tap water should be of approximately 30 ml ) . 
the solution test prepared , and should be bue immediately by the patient and the time of the absorption should be noted . 
use in these patients , peel-off samples code-barre intitulées &quot; baseline 30-minutes &quot; . 
the tubes containing blood samples must be envoyés in the original package in order to a laboratory qualified for analysis . 
analysis of samples respiratory and specification of test for laboratoires 
samples tubes respiratory recueillis in the blood in the glass and plastic 10 ml were analysed by the proportion of isotopique by spectrométrie mass ( imrs ) . 
analysis of the proportion of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase part of the package for diagnostic helicobacter test infai for children agés 3 to 11 years of age . 
the exactitude of test is intimement related to the quality of the respiratory analysis . 
the specification of spectromètre of mass parameters such as the linearity , stability ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for exactitude nervous system . 
it should be sure analysis to be performed by laboratoires qualifiés . 
the precise methodology validée for this use are as follows : 
preparation of the sample for irms 
to determine the proportion 13c / 12c of the gas anhydrase the respiratory by mass spectrométrie of the gas anhydrase should be isolated from the sample breathing and introduit in the spectromètre of mass . 
the automatic for the preparation of mass spectromètres isotopiques used for the analysis of the test breathing is based on a recombinant séparation by chromatographie do to flow continued . 
the water is extracted from the sample using a piège to water nafion or with the preparation of chromatographie do that sépare each gas in a column of chromatographie do with the hélium as éluant . 
moving into the column , all types of gas respiratory were detected with a détecteur ionique . 
the amount of gas anhydrase , identified by the time of retention characteristic , is inserted into the spectromètre of mass . 
analysis of by spectrométrie mass 
for analyser the gas anhydrase isolated from the sample , its molecule should be ionisée , beam , accélérée by a champ électrique , déviée by a champ resonance imaging and finalement detected . 
these five steps if effectuent in the analyseur a mass spectromètre of which is represented three parts divided : the source , the tube and the disposal unit . 
the ionisation , the formation of beam and detection are given in the disposal unit . 
introduction of sample 
there is to put the gas anhydrase in the analyseur , several organ introduction . 
for the analysis of the test breathing , équilibrage assessment of the gas anhydrase of sample with a reference gas standard is essential . 
this provided high exactitude to this system , when the calculation of the contents of the gas anhydrase isotopique is achieved by compared to a standard indépendant . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of test breathing is based on the administration of urea specifically étiquetée 13c whose metabolism is follow-up , but it also measured the 13co2 in the gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètre of mass should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum 3 analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation . 
safe opportunity : 
upon storage of parameters surgery and on the results with the opportunity protected to avoid manipulations effect . 
19 
boucle of sample : 
&lt; 200 l ; 
tests to check the specification are from linearity , stability ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures . 
all spectromètres of mass for analysis of the respiratory should respond to the following specification : 
there is an infection at helicobacter pylori if the difference between the proportion of 13c / 12c at baseline and to 30 minutes is greater than 4 . 
the measures properly evaluated may be used with laboratoires objectivement qualifiés .

the following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only : 
analysis of the test and specification samples for laboratoires 
respiratory , recueilli samples in a sac of 100 ml , were analysed by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive ( ndir ) . 
the analysis of the proportion of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase intégrante is part of the package for diagnosis helicobacter infai test . 
the exactitude of test is intimement related to the quality of the respiratory analysis . 
the specification in some of the analysis breathing such as the linearity , 53 stability ( précision of the gas ) and the reference précision measures are essentielles for exactitude nervous system . 
it is necessary to ensure that the analysis to be performed by laboratoires qualifiés . 
it is recommended to perform the analysis , as soon as possible after collect the samples ) , and in no case after 4 weeks . 
how is validée are as follows : 
preparation of samples for the spectrométrie infrarouge 
the rate of 13c / 12c in the gas anhydrase samples respiratory is determined directly into the gas breathing expiré . 
the gas breathing within tubes is introduit in the spectromètre ndir in pump gas . 
the content of water respiratory sample is maintained about consistent with a piège to water nafion . 
the pens free of co2 ( gas ) to the reference étalonnage and to the measurement is made using an absorbeur of co2 intégré to analyseur . 
analysis spectrométrique infrarouge 
for analyser the gas anhydrase content of the gas breathing , a rayonnement wide band émis by a source infrarouge is dirigé turn to all into the chamber to measure and into the chamber to a hacheur of beam . 
it is used for détecteurs of transmission to double layer with a chamber before and chamber back syringes each one of the gas isotopiquement purs to measure respectively ( 13co2 or 12co2 ) . 
in the chamber to measure the rayonnement infrarouge is affaibli by the component gazeux to measure which perturbe balance between the beam to measure and the reference beam . 
a fluctuation of temperature occurs and results in a fluctuation the pressure in the chamber before of détecteur infrarouge . 
a condensateur membrane relié to this chamber and exposed to a continued common resistance a source of high blood pressure fluctuations in the common alternatif , which helps to measure the statement isotopique of the gas anhydrase present in the gas breathing . 
introduction of sample 
an increase in introduction semi-automatique are given the gas of measure in amounts assessed in the reference gas circulating in the circuit of spectromètre infrarouge . 
this helps to measure the relationship 13c / 12c all concentrations of co2 above 1 . 
specification for the determination of the proportion 13c / 12c 
the concept of test breathing is based on the oral dose of urea étiquetée 13c whose is followed by enzymatic hydrolysis , but it also measured by spectrométrie infrarouge not dispersive the 13co2 in the gas respiratory expirés . 
the spectromètre infrarouge for gas respiratory should be able to : 
several analyses repeated : 
minimum three analyses repeated on the same sample during the operation safe opportunity : 
upon storage of parameters surgery and on the results with the opportunity protected to avoid further manipulations 
to ensure the specification , tests linearity , stability and précision measures should be performed . 
dose adjustment of the site zero of détecteurs , using the reference gas généré by the spectromètre . 
dose adjustment of the site end of détecteurs using gas of étalonnage including the concentrate is known . 
0.5 for samples respiratory including the concentration of linearity : 
co2- varies between 1 and 7 0.3 on 10 pulses after stability : 0.5 for 13c in abondance neutralization using a tube of measure : respiratory of 100ml with a concentration of 3 of co2 breathing 
there is an infection at helicobacter pylori if the difference between the proportion of 13c / 12c at baseline and established after 30 minutes is greater than 4.0 .

in the body , it is one of the active substances ( factors ) involved in blood coagulation . 
patients with haemophilia has a lack factor viii , this causes blood coagulation problems , such as bleeding in the joints , muscle or internal organs . 
helixate nexgen is used to replace the missing factor viii . 
it corrects the factor viii and gives temporary control of bleeding . 
octocog alfa is not extracted of human plasma , but produced by a method known as recombinant dna technology : it is made by a cell that has received a gene ( dna ) , which makes it able to produce the factor viii adsorption . 
7 westferry circus , canary wharf , london e14 4hb , uk tel . 
helixate nexgen is similar to the medicinal product kogenate , but is prepared differently , so that there is no protein human- in the medicine . 
helixate nexgen was also studied as a continuous infusion with 15 patients with haemophilia undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention high . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the assessment of the doctor on discontinuation effectif of bleeding . 
what benefit has demonstrated by helixate nexgen during the studies ? 
in previously treated patients , overall , ci haemorrhage responded to one or two injections of helixate intraveineuses nexgen . 
in previously untreated patients , approximately 90 of bleeding responded to treatment with one or two injections intraveineuses . 
when helixate nexgen was given by continuous infusion , discontinuation of bleeding was evaluated as excellent for the 15 patients . 
what is the risk associated with the use of helixate nexgen ? 
patients with haemophilia may develop antibodies ( inhibitors ) factor viii . 
a antibodies is a protein produced by the body in reaction to unknown agents , part of the natural defence system of the body . 
in clinical trials with helixate nexgen , this is produced in 14 of patients who had received any treatment previously and 17 of patients who had previously treatment than 100 days . 
if the antibodies develop , helixate nexgen not working properly . 
hypersensitivity ( allergic ) has not been observed in patients treated with medicinal products containing a factor viii . 
helixate nexgen should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to factor viii recombinant coagulation , mouse protein or hamster or to any of the other ingredients . 
why has nexgen helixate been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( chmp ) decided that helixate nexgen &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia ( congenital factor viii ) . 
the committee recommended that of the marketing authorisation holder is given helixate nexgen .

clinical particulars 
therapeutic indications 
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia has ( congenital factor viii ) . 
this preparation does not contain factor von willebrand disease and therefore should not be used in the treatment of the disease of willebrand disease . 
posology and method of administration 
treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with haemophilia . 
dosage the number of units factor viii given is expressed in international units ( iu ) compared to standard current the who for concentrates of factors viii . 
the factor viii activity in plasma is expressed either in the percentage ( relative to human plasma normal ) , or in international units ( relative to a international for factor viii plasma ) . 
a international units ( iu ) of factor viii corresponds to the amount of factor viii in one ml of human plasma . 
2 the calculation of the required dose of is based on the outcome empirical as 1 international units ( iu ) of factor viii per kg bodyweight increases the activity of the plasma concentration of 1.5 to 2.5 . 
the required dose determined using the following formulas : 
i. 
nb of iu = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor viii rise ( of normal ) x 0.5 
increased expected factor viii rise ( of normal ) = 2 x nb of iu given body weight ( kg ) 
the doses and duration of replacement therapy should be adjusted depending upon the patient &apos;s needs ( weight , severity of disorders of haemostasis , injection site and the rate of bleeding , titre in for inhibitor and factor viii levels level ) .

during the course of treatment , a measure appropriate levels is recommended in order to evaluate the dose to be administered and the frequency at which repeat infusions . 
in the case of major surgery , a follow-up précis of replacement therapy by an analysis of blood clotting ( plasma factor viii ) is indispensable . 
responses of patients with the individual factor viii may vary , resulting in a blood in vivo recovery and different half-life . 
4 a clinical study in adult patients with haemophilia has who have had a surgery showed that helixate nexgen can be used as a continuous infusion surgery ( in the pre- , per- and postoperative ) . 
in this study , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlébites at the site of infusion as with any intravenous infusion . 
helixate nexgen contains a low levels of polysorbate- 80 , excipient known to increase the rate of extraction of do 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from materials polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) . 
this should be taken into account when administered as a continuous infusion . 
for the treatment prophylactic of bleeding in patients with severe , doses ranging from 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg bodyweight , should be given every 2 to 3 days . 
in some cases , especially in the younger patients , most often between the dose or higher doses may be necessary . 
there have been generated in 61 children aged less than 6 years of age . 
cases of patients with inhibitors 
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii . 
if the haemoglobin activity factor viii in plasma is not controlled , or if bleeding are not controlled with the appropriate doses , the presence of a factor viii should be evaluated with laboratory tests . 
if a is present to a titre less than 10 units ( bu ) ( bu ) per ml , the administration of a dose additional factor viii technology may neutraliser the inhibitor , and to identify continue to obtain a clinical response to treatment with helixate nexgen . 
however , in the presence of a doses necessary are variable and should be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical response and the strength of the plasma factor viii . 
in patients with the potency of the exceeds 10 bu or who have a higher anamnestique response , the use of a concentrate of complex prothrombique activated or by a factor vii activated technology ( rfviia ) should be considered . 
such drugs should be a by physicians experienced in the normal to treat patients with haemophilia a. 
method of administration dissolve preparation as described in section 6.6 . 
helixate nexgen should be injected by the intravenous route on few minutes . 
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient convenience ( maximum rate of injection : 
helixate nexgen can be given by continuous infusion . 
the infusion rate should be calculated according to the clearance and the factor viii levels to achieve . 
example : for a patient 75 kg that the clearance of 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate may be due to 3 iu / h / kg to obtain a fviii 100 . 
for calculate in ml / h , it should be multiply the infusion rate in iu / h / kg , with the next &#91; kg of body weight / concentration of the solution ( iu / ml ) ) .

infusion of vitesses higher may be warranted in situations where renal clearance is accélérée in important haemorrhage or étendues tissue during surgery . 
the infusion vitesses further should be calculated using the actual factor viii achieved during each days after the operation using the following equation : 
contraindications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance , mouse protein or hamster or to any of the excipients . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
as with any medicinal product species intravenous protein , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible . 
patients should be informed that the onset of chest tightness , dizziness , hypotension , slight and nausea during the infusion may be the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis . 
symptomatic treatment and the treatment of hypersensitivity should be instaurés . 
if severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions injection or infusion solution should be immediately discontinued and patients should contact their physician . 
in case of shock , treatment for shock should be initiated . 
antibody formation neutralisant ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia a. 
these inhibitors are always of immunoglobulin g dirigées compared with the activity pro-coagulante factor viii and are quantifiés in international ( bu ) modified ( bu ) per ml in plasma . 
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated between other , exposure to factor viii and genetic ; this risk is the higher within 20 days exposure to antigen . 
more rarely , inhibitors may occur after the first 100 exposure days . 
cases of recurrent inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after change by a factor viii technology with another in patients treated with more than 100 days exposure and a history of inhibitors . 
patients treated with factor viii technology should be carefully monitored clinically , and with laboratory tests appropriate , in order to dépister development of inhibitors . 
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects . 
in a clinical study with the use of continuous infusion surgery , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlebitis at the site of infusion as with any intravenous infusion .

the dose and frequency of administration should always be oriented for each individual cases based on clinical efficacy noted . 
in some circumstances , doses higher than calculated may be necessary , especially during the first administration . 
during the course of treatment , a measure appropriate levels is recommended in order to evaluate the dose to be administered and the frequency at which repeat infusions . 
in the case of major surgery , a follow-up précis of replacement therapy by an analysis of blood clotting ( plasma factor viii ) is indispensable . 
responses of patients with the individual factor viii may vary , resulting in a blood in vivo recovery and different half-life . 
22 a clinical study in adult patients with haemophilia has who have had a surgery showed that helixate nexgen can be used as a continuous infusion surgery ( in the pre- , per- and postoperative ) . 
in this study , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlébites at the site of infusion as with any intravenous infusion . 
helixate nexgen contains a low levels of polysorbate- 80 , excipient known to increase the rate of extraction of do 2-ethylhexyl ) phthalate ( dehp ) extraction from materials polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) . 
this should be taken into account when administered as a continuous infusion . 
for the treatment prophylactic of bleeding in patients with severe , doses ranging from 20 to 60 iu of helixate nexgen per kg bodyweight , should be given every 2 to 3 days . 
in some cases , especially in the younger patients , most often between the dose or higher doses may be necessary . 
there have been generated in 61 children aged less than 6 years of age . 
cases of patients with inhibitors 
patients should be monitored for the development of factor viii . 
if the haemoglobin activity factor viii in plasma is not controlled , or if bleeding are not controlled with the appropriate doses , the presence of a factor viii should be evaluated with laboratory tests . 
if a is present to a titre less than 10 units ( bu ) ( bu ) per ml , the administration of a dose additional factor viii technology may neutraliser the inhibitor , and to identify continue to obtain a clinical response to treatment with helixate nexgen . 
however , in the presence of a doses necessary are variable and should be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical response and the strength of the plasma factor viii . 
in patients with the potency of the exceeds 10 bu or who have a higher anamnestique response , the use of a concentrate of complex prothrombique activated or by a factor vii activated technology ( rfviia ) should be considered . 
such drugs should be a by physicians experienced in the normal to treat patients with haemophilia a. 
method of administration dissolve preparation as described in section 6.6 . 
helixate nexgen should be injected by the intravenous route on few minutes . 
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient convenience ( maximum rate of injection : 
helixate nexgen can be given by continuous infusion . 
the infusion rate should be calculated according to the clearance and the factor viii levels to achieve . 
example : for a patient 75 kg that the clearance of 3 ml / h / kg , the initial infusion rate may be due to 3 iu / h / kg to obtain a fviii 100 . 
for calculate in ml / h , it should be multiply the infusion rate in iu / h / kg , with the next &#91; kg of body weight / concentration of the solution ( iu / ml ) ) .

infusion of vitesses higher may be warranted in situations where renal clearance is accélérée in important haemorrhage or étendues tissue during surgery . 
the infusion vitesses further should be calculated using the actual factor viii achieved during each days after the operation using the following equation : 
contraindications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance , mouse protein or hamster or to any of the excipients . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
as with any medicinal product species intravenous protein , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible . 
patients should be informed that the onset of chest tightness , dizziness , hypotension , slight and nausea during the infusion may be the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis . 
symptomatic treatment and the treatment of hypersensitivity should be instaurés . 
if severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions injection or infusion solution should be immediately discontinued and patients should contact their physician . 
in case of shock , treatment for shock should be initiated . 
antibody formation neutralisant ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia a. 
these inhibitors are always of immunoglobulin g dirigées compared with the activity pro-coagulante factor viii and are quantifiés in international ( bu ) modified ( bu ) per ml in plasma . 
the risk of developing inhibitors is correlated between other , exposure to factor viii and genetic ; this risk is the higher within 20 days exposure to antigen . 
more rarely , inhibitors may occur after the first 100 exposure days . 
cases of recurrent inhibitors ( low titre ) have been observed after change by a factor viii technology with another in patients treated with more than 100 days exposure and a history of inhibitors . 
patients treated with factor viii technology should be carefully monitored clinically , and with laboratory tests appropriate , in order to dépister development of inhibitors . 
see also section 4.8 undesirable effects . 
in a clinical study with the use of continuous infusion surgery , heparin has been used to prevent the occurrence of thrombophlebitis at the site of infusion as with any intravenous infusion . 
in the interest of patients , it is recommended , lorque it is possible , as recorded helixate nexgen , the name and batch number of the product is enregistré . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial , i. e. essentially sodium free . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
no interaction of helixate nexgen with other medicinal products is not known . 
pregnancy and lactation 
helixate nexgen has not been studied in reproduction studies in animals . 
in view of the rarity of haemophilia has in the female there are no data on the use of helixate nexgen in pregnant women or during breast-feeding . 
therefore , helixate nexgen should be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding as if the indication is incontestable . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
helixate nexgen has no effect on the ability to drive and use machines .
