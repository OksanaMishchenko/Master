PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : 
non selective recharge of monoamine , atc ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the clomipramine has a wide spectre works by blocking the recaptage neuronal both ( 5HT ) and noradrenaline . 
therefore , it has the conjointes properties of an inhibitor of recaptage and with an antidepressant tricyclique . 
the active molecules in vivo are clomipramine and its main metabolite , déméthylclomipramine . 
the clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine contribute to the activity of Clomicalm : the clomipramine is a potent and selective inhibitor of recaptage serotonin 5HT , whereas the déméthylclomipramine is a potent and selective inhibitor of recaptage norepinephrine . 
the mechanism of action endpoint of the clomipramine is in the effects of st john and serotonin 5HT in the brain by inhibition of recaptage neuronal . 
in addition , the clomipramine has any effects anticholinergiques by its action antagonist on muscarinic receptors cholinergic . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the absorption of the gastrointestinal clomipramine administered orally is good ( &gt; 80 ) , in dogs , but the bioavailability of the clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine is 22 to 26 due to extensive first . 
peak plasma concentrations occurring in the clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine are rapidly ( 1.5 to 2.5 hours ) . 
peak plasma levels ( Cmax ) following a single oral dose of 2 mg / kg hydrochloride clomipramine are 240 nmol / l for the clomipramine and 48 nmol / l for the déméthylclomipramine . 
in repeated dosing of Clomicalm entrainent a mild increase of plasma levels , the relationship of accumulation after oral administration twice daily is 1.2 for the clomipramine and 1.6 for the déméthylclomipramine , steady state is achieved within 3 days . 
at steady state , the proportion of concentrations clomipramine and déméthylclomipramine is approximately 3 to 1 . 
when Clomicalm is administered with food , the plasma AUC are slightly higher than the 25 for clomipramine and 
4 , 8 to déméthylclomipramine , compared to data of administration in dogs on an empty stomach . 
the clomipramine binds extensively bound to plasma proteins ( &gt; 97 ) in the dog . 
in dogs , the volume of distribution is 3.8 l / kg . 
the major route of the biotransformation of clomipramine is déméthylation in déméthylclomipramine .

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : 
antibacterial for systemic use ( céphalosporines ) Code vetATC : 
QJ01DD91 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the céfovécine is a céphalosporine of third generation offspring that has a wide spectre of activity against the bacteria Gram-positif and Gram-négatif . 
it is différencie there other céphalosporines by its high protein binding and its prolonged duration of action . 
as with all céphalosporines , the action of céfovécine result of the inhibition of the synthesis of bacterial ; the céfovecine has a bactéricide activity . 
the céfovécine has a activity in vitro against Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella multocida which are associated with to infections of the skin in dogs and chats . 
it has also been prouvé that the bacteria anaérobies as Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. alone in abscesses félins are susceptible to the céfovécine . 
in addition , the céfovécine has a activity in vitro against Escherichia coli which is associated with the urinary tract infections in dogs and chats .

the most small concentration , which inhibits completely growth visible precipitates of at least 50 of isolates 2 La more small concentration , which inhibits completely growth visible precipitates of no less than 90 of isolates 3 Certains of these pathogènes ( e. g . 
S. aureus ) have shown in vitro resistance to the natural céfovécine 4 La clinical relevance of these findings in vitro has not been demonstrated . 
the resistance to inactivation céphalosporines result of an enzyme ( production de-lactamase ) , a reduction of the permeability by mutations of porines or change in efflux , or séléction protein low affinités for penicillin . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be sent if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
a cross-resistance with other céphalosporines and other béta-lactamines may be observed . 
in appliquant critique concentration view suggested of S 2 g / ml , no resistance to the céfovécine has been detected in the isolates terrains of Pasteurella multocida and Fusobacterium spp . 
in appliquant critique concentration view suggested of I 4 g / ml , resistance to the céfovécine in clinical isolates of S. intermedius and Streptococci béta-hémolitique is lower than 0.02 . 
the percentage of isolates resistant of E. coli , Prevotella oralis , Bacteroides spp. and Proteus spp. were by 2.3 , 2.7 , 3.1 and 1.4 . 
the percentage of isolates Staphylococci spp. coagulase negative ( e. g. 
S. xylosus , S. schleiferi , S. epidermidis ) resistant to céfovécine is 9.5 . 
clinical isolates of Pseudomonas spp . , Enterococcus spp . , and Bordetella bronchiseptica are intrinsèquement resistant to céfovécine . 
pharmacokinetic properties

the medicine vétérinaire contains the active substance hydrocortisone acéponate . 
the hydrocortisone acéponate ( HCA ) is a dermocorticoïde with activity intrinsic glucocorticoid has which means a reduction of the inflammation and itching , leading to a rapid improvement of skin lesions observed in dermatites inflammatory and itchy . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the HCA is a glucocorticoid , a member of the diesters . 
the diesters are ingredients lipophiles which assurent a high getting into the skin associated with a low availability in plasma . 
the HCA accumulates in the skin in the dog at local efficacy at lower doses . 
the diesters are biotransformés into the skin . 
this transformation is responsible for the puissance in the therapeutic class . 
in animals laboratory the hydrocortisone acéponate is excreted in the same way as the hydrocortisone ( another name for the cortisol endogenous ) in the urine and faeces . 
the application topical of diesters result in a index therapeutic high : local activity high with systemic side effects reduced .

DEXDOMITOR has also been compared to the médétomidine , in the indication of préanesthésie in chats an general anaesthesia and ketamine , and in the indication of sedation deep of dog , in combination with the butorphanol . 
finally , DEXDOMITOR has been studied as préanesthésie in dogs , before induction of the general anaesthesia . 
what benefit has demonstrated by DEXDOMITOR during the studies ? 
studies have shown that DEXDOMITOR was effective as the médétomidine for the induction of the sedation and for the analgésie in dogs and chat . 
in the médétomidine , analgésie good or excellent was achieved in approximately in animals , to support its use in the setting not invasive involving pain mild to moderate . 
DEXDOMITOR was at least as effective as the médétomidine in the induction of anaesthesia general in the chat , in combination with ketamine .

there was also reported cases of ventricular arrhythmias . 
the respiratory symptoms and hémodynamiques should be treated accordingly symptomatic . 
the specific of the receptor antagonist 2-adrénergiques , atipamézole , authorised for use in animals , has been used in humans that in expérimentale to opposer effects caused by the dexmédétomidine . 
people with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to the other ingredients of the medicinal product must be administered with caution . 
the side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
because of its activity 2-adrénergique , dexmédétomidine causes a reduction in heart rate and body temperature . 
blood pressure will start by increase , and then is normalise or achieved values lower than normal . 
in dogs and chats , a reduction in frequency breathing may occur . 
because of the vasoconstriction peripheral and désaturation venous in one animal with further oxygenation blood normal , a pale and / or cyanosis lining may be observed . 
there have been rare reports of few pulmonary oedema . 
vomiting may occur 5 to 10 minutes after the injection . 
some dogs , and some chats may also sick at waking up . 
of tremor muscle may occur during the sedation . 
of opacités of cornea may occur during the sedation ( see also section 4.5 ) . 
in case of taking sequential of dexmédétomidine and ketamine , over the range of 10 minutes , chats can sometimes have bundle auriculo-ventriculaire or extra heart beats . 
respiratory reactions expected are bradypnée , a schedule breathing intermittent , hypoventilation and apnoea . 
in clinical trials , the incidence of reports of hypoxaemia were common , particularly in the first 15 minutes after anaesthesia to the dexmédétomidine-kétamine . 
vomiting , hypothermia and cases of nervousness have been reported after this type of administration . 
cases of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia have been reported . 
they may include a sinus bradycardia deep , blocs auriculo-ventriculaires the first and second degree , discontinuation sinusal , as well as historically fibrillation and supra-ventricular arrhythmia , , and an extra heart beats ventricular . 
cases of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia have been reported . 
they may include a sinus bradycardia deep , blocs auriculo-ventriculaires the first and second degree , as well as discontinuation sinusal . 
of historically supra-ventricular arrhythmia , , extra heart beats ventricular , pause sinus and blocs auriculo-ventriculaires third degree have been reported in rare cases . 
use in the event of gravidité , lactation or ponte 
the safety of the dexmédétomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation in both species targets . 
therefore , its use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended . 
interactions and other 
concomitant use of other central nervous system dépresseurs should lead to an additive effects of the dexmédétomidine , the dosage should , therefore , be adjusted accordingly . 
the use of anticholinergiques with dexmédétomidine should be given with caution . 
administration of atipamézole after the dexmédétomidine reciprocal rapidly its effects and raccourcit , therefore , the time of recovery . 
in general , dogs is réveillent and tiennent on their pattes at 15 minutes . 
chats : 
due to the concomitant administration of 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg body weight vif intramuscularly and 5 mg ketamine / kg poidsvif , the maximum concentration of dexmédétomidine was doubled , but it was shown to have no effect on T max . 
the mean elimination half-life of the dexmédétomidine is passée to 1.6 h and the total exposure ( AUC ) was increased by 50 . 
the concomitant administration of a dose of 10 mg of ketamine / kg and 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg can cause fits tachycardia .

posology and route of administration 
this medicinal product is designed to : 
- Chiens : intravenous or intramuscular use 
- Chats : intramuscular use 
this medicinal product does not censé be injected in a few times . 
it may mix the dexdormitor , butorphanol and / or ketamine in the same syringe their pharmaceutical it has been demonstrated . 
the recommended doses are as follows : 
dogs : 
the dose for dogs are depending on their surface area . 
the dose is 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area intravenously and 500 micrograms / m2 intramuscularly when the dexmédétomidine is used as a single agent they experience sedation and analgésie . 
the dosage should be adjusted according to type of surgery , the duration of the procedure and tempérament of the patient . 
5 L&apos; use simultaneous dexmédétomidine and butorphanol results in a sedation and analgésie with the effects occur within 15 minutes . 
the effects on other and analgesics are maximaux 30 minutes after administration. and remain , respectively , for up to 120 minutes and 90 minutes after administration . 
as a waking up abortion within 3 hours . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen significantly reduces the dosage of the agent induction necessary , as well as the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia . 
in a clinical study , the dose of propofol and thiopental requested respectively , have been reduced 30 and 60 . 
all anaesthetic agents used for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia should be given until the colour of the effect escompté . 
an additional clinical study showed that the dexmédétomidine contribuait to a analgésie postoperative 0.5 to 4 hours . 
however , dependent on the duration of a number of variableset a dose of analgesic additional can therefore be given , according to the advice . 
the following tables répertorient the corresponding doses on the basis of body weight vif . 
in order to ensure an assay précis when administering small volumes , it is recommended to use a syringe marked .

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : psycholeptique , atc ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the dexmédétomidine is the active substance of Dexdomitor which acts as a sédatif and analgesic in dogs and chats . 
the duration and the depth the sedation and analgésie are dose-dépendantes . 
the maximal effect occurring corresponds to a animals détendu , lying down , and do not respond to a stimulus extérieurs . 
the dexmédétomidine is a potent and selective receptor 2-adrénergiques , which inhibits release noradrenaline from neurones noradrénergiques . 
the neurotransmission sympathique is inhibited and the level of consciousness decreases . 
the administration of dexmédétomidine may lead to a reduction of heart rate and a blockade auriculo-ventriculaire temporary . 
after an initial increased , blood pressure decrease , reaching normal or values slightly lower . 
the frequency breathing can sometimes fall . 
the dexmédétomidine induces also a number of other effects associated with receptors 2-adrénergiques such as : pilo-érection , depression of motrices and sécrétoires from the gastrointestinal tract , output and hyperglycaemia . 
it was noted sometimes a slight decrease in temperature . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the dexmédétomidine is a compound lipophile , it is well absorbed after intramuscular administration . 
the dexmédétomidine is rapidly distributed in the body and pass easily the haematoencephalic barrier . 
in the studies performed in rats , the maximum concentration in the central nervous system is several times the corresponding plasma concentrations . 
in the blood , the dexmédétomidine is highly bound to plasma proteins ( &gt; 90 ) . 
dogs : 
after intramuscular administration of a dose of 50 micrograms / kg , the maximum plasma concentration of approximately 12 ng / ml is achieved after 0.6 h . 
the bioavailability of the dexmédétomidine achieved 60 , the apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) is 0.9 l / kg . 
the elimination half-life ( t ) is between 40 and 50 minutes . the main reactions biotransformation in dogs are hydroxylation , glucuronoconjugaison and N-méthylation in the liver . 
all metabolites known are their nitrogen- free pharmacological activity . 
the metabolites are excreted principally in urine , and to a lesser extent in the faeces . 
the dexmédétomidine has a high clearance and the elimination depends on the hepatic blood flow rate . 
it is therefore be expected to a prolongation of the elimination half-life with experience , or when the dexmédétomidine is given at the same time as other medicines influant in the circulation hepatic . 
chats : 
the maximum plasma concentration is reached approximately 0.24 h after intramuscular administration . 
after administration of 40 micrograms / kg , the Cmax is 17 ng / ml . 
the apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) is 2.2 l / kg and the elimination half-life ( t ) for one hour . 
in the chat , biotransformation reactions occur by hydroxylation in the liver . 
the metabolites are excreted principally in urine ( 51 of the dose ) and to a lesser extent in the faeces . 
as in dogs , the dexmédétomidine has a high clearance and the elimination depends on the hepatic blood flow rate . 
it is therefore be expected to a prolongation of the elimination half-life with experience , or when the dexmédétomidine is given at the same time as other medicinal products that affect your liver .

INDÉSIRABLES effects 
because of its activity 2-adrénergique , dexmédétomidine causes a reduction in heart rate and body temperature . 
blood pressure will start by increase , and then is normalise or achieved values lower than normal . 
in dogs and chats , a reduction in frequency breathing may occur . 
because of the vasoconstriction peripheral and désaturation venous in one animal with further oxygenation blood normal , a pale and / or cyanosis lining may be observed . 
there have been rare reports of oedema , pulmonary few Des vomiting may occur 5 to 10 minutes after the injection . 
some dogs , and some chats may also sick at waking up . 
of tremor muscle may occur during the sedation . 
in case of taking sequential of dexmédétomidine and ketamine , over the range of 10 minutes , chats can sometimes have bundle auriculo-ventriculaire or extra heart beats . 
respiratory reactions expected are bradypnée , a schedule breathing intermittent , hypoventilation and apnoea . 
in clinical trials , the incidence of reports of hypoxaemia were common , particularly in the first 15 minutes after anaesthesia to the dexmédétomidine-kétamine . 
vomiting , hypothermia and cases of nervousness have been reported after this type of administration . 
cases of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia have been reported . 
they may include a sinus bradycardia deep , blocs auriculo-ventriculaires the first and second degree , discontinuation sinusal , as well as historically fibrillation and supra-ventricular arrhythmia , , and an extra heart beats ventricular .

this medicinal product is designed to animals : 
- Chiens : intravenous or intramuscular use 
- Chats : intramuscular use 
this medicinal product is not expected to several injections . 
it may mix the dexdormitor , butorphanol and / or ketamine in the same syringe their pharmaceutical it has been demonstrated . 
dosing recommendations are as follows : 
dogs : 
the dose for dogs are depending on their surface area . 
the dose is 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area intravenously and 500 micrograms / m2 intramuscularly when the dexmédétomidine is used as a single agent they experience sedation and analgésie . 
when this medicinal product is taken with of butorphanol ( 0.1 mg / kg ) for the sedation and analgésie dvts ) , the dose is for intramuscular 300 micrograms / m2 of body surface area . 
the dose of the dexmédétomidine in premedication regimen is 125- 375 micrograms / m2 of body surface area administered 20 minutes before induction in the setting of procedures requiring anaesthetic . 
the dosage should be adjusted according to type of surgery , the duration of the procedure and tempérament of the patient . 
the concomitant use of dexmédétomidine and butorphanol results in a sedation and analgésie with the effects occur within 15 minutes . 
the effects on other and analgesics are maximaux 30 minutes after administration and remain , respectively , for up to 120 minutes and 90 minutes after administration . 
as a waking up abortion within 3 hours . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen significantly reduces the dosage of the agent induction necessary , as well as the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia . 
in a clinical study , the dose of propofol and thiopental requested respectively , have been reduced 30 and 60 . 
all anaesthetic agents used for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia should be given until the colour of the effect escompté . 
an additional clinical study showed that the dexmédétomidine contribuait to a analgésie postoperative 0.5 to 4 hours . 
however , dependent on the duration of a number of variablesune dose of analgesic additional can therefore be given , according to the advice . 
the following tables répertorient the corresponding doses on the basis of body weight vif . 
in order to ensure an assay précis when administering small volumes , it is recommended to use a syringe marked .

animals should be maintained at immune system and to a temperature constant during the procedure and waking up . 
allow the area time to animals disorders , agressifs or excités is calmer before starting treatment . 
the safety of the dexmédétomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation in both species targets . 
therefore , its use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended . 
the safety of the dexmédétomidine has not been established in males to reproduction . 
use with caution in those aged . 
in the chats , opacités cornéennes may occur during the sedation . 
their eyes should be applied using a lubrifiant ocular measures . 
the dosage should , therefore , be adjusted accordingly . 
the use of the dexmédétomidine as premedication regimen in dogs significantly reduces the dosage of the agent required for the induction of anaesthesia . 
the vétérinaire should be particularly burden in the administration of the agent induction by the intravenous route , until the colour of the effect escompté . 
the dexmédétomidine can also reduce the dose of the anaesthetic volatil used to maintain anaesthesia . 
the use of anticholinergiques with dexmédétomidine should be given with caution . 
chats : 
due to the concomitant administration of 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg body weight vif intramuscularly and 5 mg ketamine / kg poidsvif , the maximum concentration of dexmédétomidine was doubled , but it was shown to have no effect on T max . 
the duration of life of the mean elimination dexmédétomidine is passée to 1.6 h and the total exposure ( AUC ) was increased by 50 . 
23 L&apos; simultaneous administration of a dose of 10 mg of ketamine / kg and 40 micrograms of dexmédétomidine / kg can cause fits tachycardia . 
administration of atipamézole after the dexmédétomidine reciprocal rapidly its effects and raccourcit , therefore , the time of recovery . 
in general , dogs is réveillent and tiennent on their pattes at 15 minutes . 
for more information on the side effects , please refer to section Effets effects . 
regular and frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function is impérative . 
a oxymétrie of pulse may be useful , but there is no essential to a good monitoring . 
equipment ventilation manual may be needed in case of respiratory depression or apnoea if the dexmédétomidine and ketamine are used séquentiellement for anesthésier the chats . 
it is also recommended always be readily available in case of oxygen detection or is hypoxaemia . 
dogs and chats ill and déficients should only be given pre-treatment of dexmédétomidine before induction and maintenance of general anaesthetic , taking into consideration the balance 
in case of overdose , follow the following recommendations : 
dogs : 
10 times the initial dose of dexmédétomidine ( micrograms / kg or micrograms / m2 of body surface area ) . 
the volume of the dose of atipamézole at 5 mg / ml use is equal volume of Dexdomitor that has been administered in the dog at the route of administration of Dexdomitor . 
chats : 
in case of overdose , or if the effects of the dexmédétomidine become life-threatening for life- in animals , antagonist appropriate is atipamézole intramuscularly at the dose as follows : 
5 times the initial dose of dexmédétomidine in micrograms / kg . 
after administration of a triple overdose ( 3x ) dexmédétomidine and 15 mg of ketamine / kg , the atipamézole can be given to the animal- dose appropriée- for antagoniser the effects of the dexmédétomidine . 
to a high serum concentration of dexmédétomidine , sedation , there is no while the level of analgésie increases with the doses . 
in cases of accidental ingestion or yourself , please consult a doctor immediately and which have the package leaflet of the medicinal product but NE CONDUISEZ PAS as you may be confronté to sedation or changes in your blood pressure . 
the use of gloves imperméables is recommended .

the active substance in Dicural , difloxacine , belongs to a group of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones . 
the difloxacine works by blocking an enzyme called ADN gyrase inhibitors , which is the rate at that it helps to the bacteria of produce of copies its ADN . 
by blocking the production of ADN , difloxacine prevents the bacteria responsible for the infection of croître and grow . 
the full list of bacteria against which Dicural is active is found in the RCP . 
Quelles Dicural studies have been studied ? 
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. . 
in the poulet and dinde , nine main studies have been performed which portaient on of oiseaux with severe infections of the respiratory . 
seven main studies have been performed in the bovins , which portaient all on a comparison between Dicural and enrofloxacine in the veau . 
what benefit has demonstrated by Dicural during the studies ? 
in all species , Dicural efficacy has been shown to reduce the number of animals infected or severity of infection . 
Dicural was as effective , and a somewhat more , as the comparator antibiotics . 
what is the risk associated with the use of Dicural ? 
in the poulet and dinde , no adverse effects of Dicural is not known . 
however , as no study has been performed in oiseaux boiteux , Dicural should not be used in oiseaux with weakness of pattes or osteoporosis ( bone cassants ) . 
in dogs , the effects of Dicural , which are rare , include loss of appetite , vomiting , diarrhoea and anus irritation . 
they tend to disappear after a day or two and does not require any additional treatment . 
Dicural injection into a solution for injection under the skin may cause a few itching , swelling representative and a mild pain . 
itchy disappear after a few minutes and swelling after a few days . 
as cases of the other fluoroquinolones , difloxacine should not be used in dogs with regular because it may affect the cartilage of certain joints . 
this to the species size small and mean until eight months included , species large up to one year and species very large up to 18 months . 
Dicural should not be used in dogs epilepsy . 
in the bovins , Dicural injection into a solution for injection under the skin can cause swelling temporary at the injection site . 
Quelles are special to be taken by people who may be given the medicine or contacts animals ? 
people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) known to quinolones ( a group of antibiotic that includes the fluoroquinolones ) should avoid contact with Dicural . 
to avoid irritation of the skin and / or eyes , use of gloves and protect faces for handle Dicural intended for oral solution to poulets and dindes . 
what is the time of decision before abattage of animals and the use of goat for the human ? 
Dicural should not be given to oiseaux pondant hen to the human or in the four weeks before the start of the period of ponte . 
the poulets and dindes should not be abattus during the 24 hours after the last dose of Dicural , and the bovins should not be abattus during the 46 days of such a administration . 
why has Dicural been approved ? 
it is recommended , therefore be given marketing authorisation holder for Dicural .

the efficacy of treatment and prevention of BDR by DRAXXIN has been studied in nine main studies in the veau . 
the bovins in the prevention , with regard to those , as no symptoms of the disease . 
in clinical studies of prevention , it has also been compared with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) . 
the evaluation of the main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms , particularly in the body temperature , the respiratory and recovery over a period between two weeks and two months . 
the effectiveness of DRAXXIN as treatment of the KIR has been studied in three main studies in the veau . 
in the third study , it has also been compared with that of the oxytétracycline ( another antibiotic ) . 
of the main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of bovins guéris after three weeks . 
the effectiveness of DRAXXIN as treatment of the MRP has been studied in the porcs in two main studies , compared to the tiamuline or florfenicol . 
the evaluation of the main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms for 10 days . 
the effectiveness of DRAXXIN for the prevention of MRP has been studied in six main studies , compared with placebo . 
the evaluation of the main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of porcs monitored until the end of the three or six weeks complete each study without need to remove the study due to the MRP . 
what benefit has demonstrated by DRAXXIN during the studies ?

in two of the three studies involving the KIR , DRAXXIN s was more effective than placebo in cure , the disease . 
however , the third study has established no difference between DRAXXIN efficacy , oxytétracycline and placebo . 
the reasons of these findings are not well established . 
what is the risk associated with the use of DRAXXIN ? 
the subcutaneous injection of DRAXXIN to bovins causes often pain and swelling temporary at the site of injection , which may last up to 30 days . 
these reactions were not observed in the porcs after the injection . 
other types of reaction at the injection durent approximately 30 days in bovins and porcs . 
what is the time of decision before animals treatment may be abattu and its goat be appropriate for the human ? 
in the case of bovins including goat or abats are for human use , wait 49 days before abattage . 
in the case of porcs including goat or abats are for human use , wait 33 days .

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : 
macrolide , atc ATCvet : 
QJ01FA94 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the tulathromycine is an antibiotic semi-synthetic the family of macrolide , from a fermentation process . 
it is différencie of many of the other macrolide by a prolonged duration of activity , which is part due to its 3 groups acids , and therefore it part of the sous-classe of triamilides . 
the are macrolide antibiotics which have an activity bacteriostatic , they may inhibit the biosynthèse proteins in to their binding selective to ARN the bacterial ribosome . 
they act in stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-ARNt and ribosome during the process of translocation . 
4 La tulathromycine has an in vitro activity on Mannheima haemolytica , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Haemophilus parasuis the bacteria pathogènes the most commonly in the conditions respiratory bovines and porcines respectively . 
increased values of CMI was trouvée for some isolates Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae . 
the tulathromycine was also a activity in vitro against Moraxella bovis , which is the virus bacterial the most commonly associated with the kératoconjonctivite infectious bovine ( KCIB ) . 
resistance MLSB may be constitutive or inductible . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be transférable if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
in the bovins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and to the slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.5 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after dosing ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in the lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
high accumulation of the tulathromycine in the neutrophil count and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of tulatromycine in vivo at the site of infection in the lungs is not known . 
peak concentrations are followed by a slow exposure with a terminal ( T ) apparent elimination of 90 hours in plasma . 
the plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( VSS ) determined after intravenous administration is 11 l / kg . 
the bioavailability of the tulathromycine after subcutaneous administration in the bovins is approximately 90 . 
in the porcins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following an intramuscular administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid also absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and to the slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.6 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after dosing ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in the lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
high accumulation of the tulathromycine in the neutrophil count and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of tulatromycine in vivo at the site of infection in the lungs is not known . peak concentrations are followed by a slow exposure ( T ) with a half-life of elimination apparent 91 hours in plasma . 
the plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( VSS ) determined after intravenous administration is 13.2 l / kg .

the tulathromycine is an antibiotic semi-synthetic the family of macrolide , from a fermentation process . 
it is différencie of many of the other macrolide by a prolonged duration of activity , which is part due to its 3 groups acids , and therefore it part of the sous-classe of triamilides . 
the are macrolide antibiotics which have an activity bacteriostatic , they may inhibit the biosynthèse proteins in to their binding selective to ARN the bacterial ribosome . 
they act in stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-ARNt and ribosome during the process of translocation . 
the tulathromycine has an in vitro activity on Mannheima haemolytica , Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , Pasteurella multocida , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Haemophilus parasuis the bacteria pathogènes the most commonly in the conditions respiratory bovines and porcines respectively . 
increased values of CMI was trouvée for some isolates Histophilus somni and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae . 
the tulathromycine was also a activity in vitro against Moraxella bovis , which is the virus bacterial the most commonly associated with the kératoconjonctivite infectious bovine ( KCIB ) . 
resistance MLSB may be constitutive or inductible . 
resistance may be chromosomal or plasmidique and be transférable if it is associated with transposons or plasmides . 
in the bovins , the pharmacokinetic profile of the tulathromycine following a single subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg / kg is characterised by a rapid absorption and extensive followed by a wide distribution and to the slow elimination . 
the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is approximately 0.5 g / ml and is reached approximately 30 minutes after dosing ( Tmax ) . 
the concentration of tulathromycine in the lungs is considerably higher than in plasma . 
high accumulation of the tulathromycine in the neutrophil count and macrophages alvéolaires has been very clearly demonstrated . 
however , the concentration of tulatromycine in vivo at the site of infection in the lungs is not known . 
peak concentrations are followed by a slow exposure with a terminal ( T ) apparent elimination of 90 hours in plasma . 
the plasma protein binding is low , approximately 40 . 
the steady-state volume of distribution ( VSS ) determined after intravenous administration is 11 l / kg . 
37 La bioavailability of the tulathromycine after subcutaneous administration in the bovins is approximately 90 .

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : 
medicines otologiques Association corticosteroids and antiinfectieux Code ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the medicine vétérinaire is a fixed combination three active substances ( corticosteroid , antifungal and antibiotic ) . 
4 / 20 L&apos; acéponate of hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid , a member of the diésters which has activity intrinsic glucocorticoid has which means a reduction of the inflammation and itching , leading to an improvement in clinical observed in the otite middle . 
the nitrate of miconazole is a synthetic derivative of imidazole with an antifungal activity pronounced . 
the miconazole selectively inhibits the synthesis of ergostérol which is an essential component of the membrane of filamentous and yeast , including Malassezia pachydermatis . 
the mechanisms of resistance to azolés consist of an indication of accumulation of the antifungal or a change in the enzyme target range . 
no cut sensitivity standardisée in-vitro has not been defined for the miconazole ; however , with the precise methodology used by Diagnostics Pasteur , no strain résistante has been trouvée . 
the sulphate of gentamicine is an antibiotic bactéricide the family of aminoglycosides which works by inhibiting the protein synthesis . 
its spectre of action couvre the bacteria Gram-positives and Gram-négatives such as the following pathogènes germes isolated ear of dogs : 
CMI50 ( g / ml ) 
CMI90 ( g / ml ) 
values CMI ( g / ml ) 
Staphylococcus spp Streptococcus spp Pseudomonas spp Escherichia coli 
8 4 2 
CMI- Concentration Minimale Inhibitrice 
Etant bacterial strains as there may be involved in the middle of otite dogs , the mechanisms of resistance may vary . 
the phénotypes resistance bacterial to the gentamicine if appuient mainly on three mechanisms : changes enzyme of aminoglycosides , failure intracellular penetration of the active substance and alteration of the target range of aminoglycoside . 
the cross-resistance is generally related to pumps to effluent which confèrent resistance aux- lactamines , to quinolones and tétracyclines according to the spécificité the pump compared to substrate . 
there were few bacteria resistant organisms alone of cases of otites canines before treatment ( according to the Ligne directrice CLSI 16 g / ml ) : 2.4 and 13 of Staphylococcus spp . 
( on 122 strains ) and Proteus spp . 
( on 16 strains ) . 
all other species bacterial ( e. g. 
Streptococcus spp , Pseudomonas spp , Escherichia coli ) were susceptible to the gentamicine . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
after instillation of the medicinal product vétérinaire in the led auditif , the absorption of gentamicine by the skin is negligible . 
5 / 20 L&apos; acéponate of hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid , a member of the diésters . 
the diésters are ingredients lipophiles that allow a better getting into the skin , added to a systemic bioavailability low . 
the conversion of diésters in monoéster C17 structures in the skin is responsible for the puissance in the therapeutic class . 
in animals laboratory , acéponate of hydrocortisone is excreted in the same way as the hydrocortisone ( another name of the cortisol endogenous ) in the urine and faeces .

the valnémuline is active against a wide spectre of bacteria , including those responsible for the dyspnea and respiratory mentioned above . 
the efficacy of the antimicrobienne valnémuline against bacteria responsible conditions included in the porcs has been studied in laboratoires microbiologiques . 
the efficacy of Econor in the indications included has been studied in any provocation ( porcs artificiellement infected with the bacteria ) or in studies in the terrain ( infections natural within conditions of the exploitation ) . 
studies on the terrain have been performed in a large number of exploitations of a countries européens on a variety of tumour races and races cross-resistance of porcs . 
Econor has been used to treat animals already affected by the disease or to prevent the éclosion of the disease in the porcs in contact with animals exploitations or in patients with a history of réapparitions repeated of the disease . 
in clinical trials , the porcs were only alimentés with the aliment with medicinal products containing the valnémuline in different concentrations ( by the disease ) for 4 weeks maximum ( by the disease ) . 
the efficacy of Econor was compared with that of oral treatment with other antibiotics approuvés in the UE for indication or animals receiving any treatment . 
Quels were benefit with Econor during the studies ?

the side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
administration of Econor to porcs led to the onset of side effects in the european Union . 
the majority of cases reported in 1999-2000 provenaient of Danemark and Suède ( 1 of Finlande and 1 of Irlande ) . 
in all countries , the incidence varied between 0.03 to 1.76 . 
in these élevages , the rate of was approximately 30 morbidity and mortality 1 . 
the porcs who had a hyperthermia , anorexia , and in severe cases the porcs had of incoordination , ataxia and restaient couchés . 
a number of these animals were also oedema or erythema ( postérieurs ) and oedema palpébral . 
in controlled clinical trials , these side effects have been studied in animals prédisposés . 
mortality was less than 1 but may be increased to infections secondary . 
when the occurrence of the side effects , immediate discontinuation of treatment is recommended . 
the porcs sévèrement with should be treated in a environment dry and own and it should add supportive measures , including the treatment of concomitant conditions . 
monitoring épidémiologique demonstrated a possible relationship between the prédisposition to the side effects and races Landrace Danois and Landrace Suédois and their croisements , and this especially in the porcs the younger patients . 
the valnémuline is well acceptée in food but of teneurs than 200 mg / kg aliment may lead to , during the first few days of administration , a transient reduction of food with inappétence .

pharmacodynamic properties 
the valnémuline is an antibiotic of a group of &apos;class whose action is inhibition of the initiation of protein synthesis at the ribosome in the bacteria . 
the spectre of action of valnémuline includes bacteria treatments with respiratory dyspnea and in the porc . 
the very valnémuline is active against Mycoplasma spp. and spirochètes as Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli .

the activity of the valnémuline is however low against Enterobacteriaceae as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
in the porc absorption after administration of a single dose of a substance radiolabelled is greater than 90 . 
a linear relationship has been established between the concentration and the dose . 
a slight accumulation was observed after administration of doses but steady state was achieved in 5 days . 
due to extensive first important , the plasma concentration varient according to the method of administration , but the valnémuline is concentre very extensively into tissues , particularly in the lung , and the liver , in comparison in plasma . 
five days after the last dose of valnémuline radiolabelled ( in a total of 15 ) in the porc , the concentration hepatic was more than 6 times higher than the plasma concentrations . 
the metabolism of valnémuline in the porc is important ; the excretion of the substance unchanged and its metabolites are primarily via biliary and 73 -95 of the total radioactivity daily is retrouvent in the faeces . 
the plasma half-life was 1,3-2,7 hours and the major part of the total radioactivity administered was excreted within 3 days and were followed the last dose .

INDESIRABLES effects 
administration of Econor to porcs led to the onset of side effects in the european Union . 
the majority of cases reported in 1999-2000 provenaient of Danemark and Suède ( 1 of Finlande and 1 of Irlande ) . 
in all countries , the incidence varied between 0.03 to 1.76 . 
in these élevages , the rate of was approximately 30 morbidity and mortality 1 . 
the porcs who had a hyperthermia , anorexia , and in severe cases the porcs had of incoordination , ataxia and restaient couchés . 
a number of these animals were also oedema or erythema ( postérieurs ) and oedema palpébral . 
in controlled clinical trials , these side effects have been studied in animals prédisposés . 
mortality was less than 1 but may be increased to infections secondary . 
when the occurrence of the side effects , immediate discontinuation of treatment is recommended . 
the porcs sévèrement with should be treated in a environment dry and own and it should add supportive measures , including the treatment of concomitant conditions . 
monitoring épidémiologique demonstrated a possible relationship between the prédisposition to the side effects and races Landrace Danois and Landrace Suédois and their croisements , and this especially in the porcs the younger patients . 
the valnémuline is well acceptée in food but of teneurs than 200 mg / kg aliment may lead to , during the first few days of administration , a transient reduction of food with inappétence .

what is Equilis StrepE ? 
Equilis StrepE is a vaccine that contains a strain vivante mutante délétée of the bacteria Streptococcus equi as active substance . 
it contains or an add-on to , or preservative . 
Equilis StrepE is supplied as a oral ( vaccine lyophilisé ) that is made up into a suspension for injection . 
the vaccine is supplied with the solvent , a applicateur and syringe with a needle . 
it is the first vaccine gourme to be authorised for chevaux in the european Union . 
what is Equilis StrepE used for ? 
Equilis StrepE is used for the immunisation of chevaux respiratory against a disease caused by the bacteria Streptococcus equi . 
this condition frequently and highly contagieuse due to this bacteria is communément called gourme . 
this condition engendre such swollen lymph glands present in head in animals that may lead to any of the upper respiratory tract bleeding and difficulty in breathing . 
this condition is infection bacterial frequently and highly contagieuse in the cheval . 
Equilis StrepE helps to reduce the signs of the disease , as well as the formation of abscess ( erythema ) to lymph glands . 
how to Equilis StrepE agit-t-il ? 
Equilis StrepE is a vaccine . 
vaccines work by teaching &apos;the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defences ) how to defend itself against diseases . 
Equilis StrepE contains small amounts of bacteria called S. equi . 
when the vaccine is given to a cheval , the immune system recognises the bacteria as foreign body and makes antibodies for the fighting . 
in case of new exposure of animals at the same bacteria , the immune system will then able to produce antibodies more quickly . 
the strain bacterial inserted into Equilis StrepE had undergone a few changes genetic ( deletion of genes ) , as it is develops less easily in the body in animals , and therefore less likely to cause disease . 
therefore , it is possible to use it for as long as the vaccine . 
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel . 
the vaccine is given as an injection of 0.2 ml of the inside of the lèvre higher of animals . 
the chevaux included had had no disease in the past , including gourme and had not been vaccinated . 
Equilis StrepE should only be used in chevaux healthy in which a risk higher chance of an infection at S. equi is possible , due to a possible relationship with chevaux from areas where the blood of the bacteria is known . 
what benefit has demonstrated by Equilis StrepE during the studies ? 
studies have shown that Equilis StrepE is effective in the active immunisation against Streptococcus equi of chevaux aged 4 months and over and in the atténuation of clinical signs , and the occurrence of abscess to lymph glands . 
after administration of Equilis StrepE , there was no evidence of a below animals touchés by symptoms of the gourme . 
there was also observed a below of abscess and lymph glands touchés . 
what is the risk associated with the use of Equilis StrepE ? 
only of chevaux healthy with a risk of infection may receive this vaccine . 
swelling is visible precipitates at the site of injection in the four hours after the vaccination and the area where the medicinal product has been injected may not be sore , or monter in temperature . 
the reaction is to be its maximum within two or three days following the injection , but the area touchée should not exceed the surface of more than 3 cm from 8 ) . 
the swelling should disappear within the first three weeks and is not expected to have an impact on the appetite in animals , or cause discomfort . 
in very rare cases , an abscess associated discharge is possible at the site of injection and lymph glands head may gonfler and cause pain , for some time . 
an increase in the body temperature for up to 2 C is possible , the day of the vaccine . 
in rare cases , loss of appetite , fever and chills may be observed . 
in very rare cases , symptoms of depression are possible .

in general , these benign oral lesions are and résorbent without treatment , but these may be associated with the salivation , swelling of the lèvre and tongue . 
use in the event of gravidité , lactation or ponte 
no data has been obtained in the chevaux . 
however , studies in animals have shown laboratory effects embryo-foetotoxiques , malformations , mise-bas delayed and a reduction of the survival rate of either . 
therefore , do not use animals to the reproduction , development or lactation . 
interactions and other 
other AINS , diuretics and substances highly protein bound may lead to an competing with the firocoxib and may therefore toxic effects . 
do not be administered in combination with other AINS or corticosteroids . 
a previous treatment with other nsaids may lead to the development or aggravation of the side effects . 
it is therefore recommended to be an without treatment with such medicinal products before instituting therapy with EQUIOXX . 
treatment simultané with molecules with an effect on the blood flow renal ( e. g. diuretics ) should be done under strict clinical use . 
any combination with medicinal products potentially nephrotoxic should be avoided due to an increased risk of toxicity in the kidney . 
posology and route of administration 
oral use . 
administer 0.1 mg firocoxib per kg bodyweight vif , once daily . 
the duration of treatment depends on the response observed but should not exceed 14 days . 
to administer EQUIOXX at a dose of 1000 mg firocoxib / kg , adjust the syringe plunger to oral administration for up to the graduation correspond to the weight of cheval . 
each graduation , imprinted with the plunger corresponds to a dose of firocoxib which helps to treat 100 kg vif . 
the contents of a syringe to oral administration may treat chevaux weighing up to 600 kg . 
in order to ensure an assay exact , therefore weight should be determined in the lowest each possible to avoid the overdose . 
to administer the firocoxib at the appropriate dose , release the knob moletée in the turning of a quarter of the glisser and turn the plunger until the graduation correspond to the weight of cheval . 
turn the knob moletée of a quarter of turn and ensure that it is blocked . 
make sure that the mouth of cheval does not contain any aliment .

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : product anti-inflammatory and anti-rhumatismal nsaid , atc ATCvet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( AINS ) of the group of Coxibs , acting by selective inhibition of the prostaglandin synthesis induced cyclooxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
the cyclo-oxygénase is responsible for the formation of prostaglandins . 
it was shown that the COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme induced by a stimulus cytokines and that would be the major responsible for the synthesis of prostanoïdes mediators of pain , inflammation , and fever . 
the Coxibs have therefore analgesics properties , anti-inflammatory medicines and antipyrétiques . 
the concentration of firocoxib necessary to inhibit 50 of the activity of the enzyme COX-2 ( CI50 ) is 0,0369 to 0,12 M , whereas the CI50 the COX-1 is 20,14 to 33,1 M.

what is Gonazon ? 
Gonazon contains the active substance azagly-nafaréline . 
Gonazon has been authorised in the concentrate for concentrate for solution for injection to saumons and also as implant for dogs . 
Gonazon implant presents a rectangular , pale off-white , 14x3x1 mm . 
what is Gonazon used for ? 
after anaesthetic , giving an injection by route intraperitoneally in the line with a median , when 1 / 2 to &lt; 1 length of nageoire the basis of the nageoire pelvienne . 
the recommended dose of 32 g / kg body weight vif . 
in the chiennes , Gonazon is also indicated for the off function ovarienne by inhibition of the synthesis of gonadotrophines . 
Gonazon is injected subcutaneously in the area of the ombilic . 
the implant can be given to chiennes from four months ( persistence mean off function reproductrice 12 months of age ) and up to 6 years of age ( persistence mean off function reproductrice 11 months ) . 
how to Gonazon fonctionne-t-il ? 
Gonazon contains the azagly-naféreline , a of a natural hormone , the gonadoréline ( GnRH ) . 
the GnRH control reproductive toxicity in the poissons by increasing the secretion of gonadotrophines on the production of tongue ufs . 
in dogs , the administration of a prolonged duration of higher doses of agonists the GnRH results in the désensibilisation of hypophyse achieving suppression for the release of gonadotrophines and reproductrice function . 
Quelles Gonazon studies have been studied ? 
in the poissons , Gonazon has been studied in three studies on the Truite arc-en-ciel , two studies on the Saumon atlantique and a study on the Omble Chevalier . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the rate of response to treatment and initiation and synchronisation anticipés the period of fraie . 
the chiennes treated with Gonazon have not had of flush throughout the study compared to chiennes who had not received treatment . 
the efficacy of the medicinal product has been demonstrated for the prevention of flush and ovulation in chiennes adults up to 7 years for one to two years of treatment . 
data on the recovery of the oestrus , oestrus ovulatoire and fertility with after treatment discontinuation ( i. e. after withdrawal of the implant ) were limited , especially for the treatment . 
Quels were benefit with Gonazon during the studies ? 
in the poissons , the results of studies have shown that Gonazon was effective for induce and synchroniser ovulation . 
in most cases , an effect has been shown to be induced in all 6 to 11 days of treatment and ovulation was generally advanced of 2 to 3 weeks . 
in the chiennes , studies demonstrated that the inserting an implant of Gonazon empêchait the flush and ovulation in chiennes adults up to 7 years for one to two years of treatment . 
Quels is the risk associated with Gonazon ? 
in the poissons , injection of Gonazon may be associated with a reduction of fertility ( ability to reproduce ) , in quality hen and survival at stage oeillé . 
in some cases , it may be due to a use too early Gonazon in the saison of fraie . 
in the chiennes , Gonazon works by inhibiting the production of anabolic sexual and may be associated with in rare cases of conditions in females prépubaires . 
Quelles are special precaution taken by people administering the medicine or entrant in contact with the studies ? 
goggles to mix the concentrate or handle the implant and avoid yourself . 
in case of accidental contact with skin or eyes , rinse thoroughly with water . 
if the solution concentrated or the diluted solution is renversée on the skin or eyes , or if the implant is auto-injecté by cerebrovascular , seek advice to a doctor and montrez-lui the package leaflet and labelling . 
wash hands after use of the medicinal product . 
why has Gonazon been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products to use vétérinaire ( CVMP ) decided that the balance of Gonazon risks for the induction and the synchronisation of ovulation for the production of tongue ufs in oeillé and alevins . 
the implants of Gonazon are effective for the off function ovarienne by inhibiting the synthesis of gonadotrophines . 
the committee recommended that the CVMP of the marketing authorisation holder for Gonazon . 
the relationship balance picture in module 6 this EPAR . 
other information about Gonazon : 
the Commission was a marketing authorisation valid throughout the european Union for Gonazon to Intervet International BV on 22 july 2003 .

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmaceutical group : gonadolibérine . 
atc ATC vet : 
pharmacodynamic properties 
the azagly-nafaréline is a synthetic the gonadoréline ( GnRH ) . 
the GnRH is produced by the neurones of hypothalamus in all species of vertébrés . 
it helps control the reproduction of poissons in modulating the secretion of gonadotrophines hypophysaires , the hormone lutéinisante ( LH ) and the hormone folliculostimulante ( FSH ) , also known as endocrinologie of poisson , respectively , as GtH-II and GtH-I . 
the analogues GnRH are peptides . 
the azagly-nafaréline , like other analogues GnRH , simule the action of GnRH , modulating the secretion of LH and FSH animals and the poissons . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
the azagly-nafaréline is rapidly absorbed after injection intra-péritonéale in the truite arc-en-ciel . 
the distribution and the metabolism of azagly-nafaréline have not been studied in animal species revendiquées . 
the azagly-nafaréline is rapidly cleared from plasma after injection intra-péritonéale , in the truite arc-en-ciel .

instructions on use spécifiant the species targets 
off function ovarienne the chienne by inhibition of the synthesis of gonadotrophines . 
Contre-indications 
do not use in the chiennes ( pré-pubères or adults ) for to reproductive toxicity ( see section mi ) . 
special warnings precaution 
based on data in clinical trials of terrain , implant may , in a small proportion of chiennes treated ( 1.2 ) , be rejeté . 
if the implant cannot be senti to the palpation in the month after administration , it is recommended to propriétaire in animals are advised to seek advice from a vétérinaire , efficacy do may , in such cases , be ensured . 
at the end of the first year of treatment , it may not be possible , to 10 cases of localiser and remove the implant . 
to minimize this problem , it is recommended to take care that implant is well given subcutaneously , especially in dogs have deposits intervals in extra-abdominal fat mass . 
the inability to localiser and remove the implant only and it is not inquiétants effects on the health of the dog . 
however , the time of return in warmth do can be safely predicted by . 
the initial flush after single administration in the chiennes adults were , in a wide proportion ( cpk ) , ovulatoires . 
in addition , after a treatment repeated , the time of the levels of warmth cannot be determined . 
there are no data available on the repeated treatment in chiennes pre- pubères . 
7 / 36 L&apos; accidental ingestion of implant by one dog does not affect the , as the oral bioavailability of the agonists GnRH is very low . 
4.5 Précautions precautions for use 
special precautions for use in animals 
the treatment in proœ supprimera strus do not flush ongoing ( proœ strus and face strus ) . 
in the absence of clinical information , do not treat chiennes under the age of 3 kg and chiennes of races géantes than 45 kg . 
in females adults , flush induites are usuellement observed in the first month after the first administration of implant . 
the frequency of flush induites is lower when the first treatment is administered as métœ strus ( 32 ) rather than anœ strus ( 84 ) . 
therefore , the first treatment should be given preferably in métœ strus . 
the incidence of flush induites after administration of a new treatment to chiennes who did not show signs status strus after previous administration of the medicinal product is estimated to be very low ( 8 ) . 
the risk of induction of flush fertiles is small in métœ strus ( 5 ) . 
the administration of Gonazon to other stages of the cycle may cause flush may be fertiles . 
if a chienne becomes pregnant after flush induites , there may be resorption embryonal and spontaneous . 
therefore , if females is eyesight as touch , heat with male should be avoided until the foam any evidence of flush ( swelling vulvaire , bleeding and attraction male ) . 
the flush induites are not observed if treatment is started prior to the onset of puberty . 
in addition , the frequency of flush induites was smaller in young female more than in the elderly . 
some of the chiennes with flush induites may the develop a pseudogestation . 
however , in clinical trials terrain , the frequency of pseudogestations in females treated is not higher than in controls females ( treated ) . 
the product administered at the recommended dose is effective in the elderly chiennes of 7 years of age and older . 
special precautions for to be taken by people who may be given the medicine vétérinaire to animals 
people manipulant the product should goggles . 
Eviter self-injection accidental . 
in cases of accidental auto-administration of implant , consult a doctor immediately and which show the package leaflet and the label of the medicinal product . 
the side effects ( frequency and severity ) 
due to the pharmacological activity ( inhibition of the production of anabolic sexual ) , the administration of agonists the GnRH may cause vaginites in the chienne . 
use in the event of gravidité , lactation or ponte 
the use of the medicinal product is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation . 
laboratory studies have shown that it is unlikely that the administration of the medicinal product during the first phase of gestation does not affect this gestation ( pregnancy is conducted term with tacrolimus of chiots viables ) . 
studies in laboratory , during which patients received concomitant chiennes 3 implants for 
4.8 Interactions drug and other 
the azagly-nafaréline is a peptide red broken down by the peptidases but not by enzymes type P-450 . 
therefore , interactions are unlikely . 
in a study of laboratory limited , concomitant administration of Gonazon and progestagènes short-acting was well tolerated . 
however , interactions with other medicinal products have not been studied . 
posology and route of administration 
the recommended dose is one implant by chienne . 
the implant may be administered in the chiennes from four months .

the product , was administered at the recommended dose is effective in the elderly chiennes seven years of age and older . 
in the chiennes including to gonadiques were blocked with success during a course of 12 months , a second treatment may be given to continue the prevention of the eye strus . 
there are no data available on animals more than twice . 
Gonazon should be injected subcutaneously , the anterior abdominal wall , for the area of the ombilic , using special aseptic . 
the method of administration are as follows : 
put the chienne on back . 
prepare aseptiquement a small area ( e.g.

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
atc ATC vet : 
the azagly-nafaréline , a the GnRH have effects on the biphasiques hypophyse when it is given as continued . 
initially , it stimulates the hypophysaire function and the secretion of gonadotrophines LH ( Luteinising Hormone ) and FSH ( Follicle Stimulating Hormone ) . 
this phase short causes flush induites within one to four weeks after the first administration of implant ( see section 4.5 ) . 
administration of a long time in désensibilisation of hypophyse to the effects of the GnRH , entrainant suppression the secretion of LH and FSH by hypophyse . 
therefore , it is not growth folliculaire ( not status strus observed ) and not . 
the excretion of the stimulation phase to that of inhibition is effectif in about 1 month . 
pharmacokinetic characteristics 
absorption : after single administration of a implant by the subcutaneous route to one dog ( of up to approximately 10 kg ) to maximal serum concentrations ( 0.13 g / ml ) of azagly-nafaréline are achieved in approximately 3.5 hours . 
after the peak concentrations of azagly-nafaréline , a slow décroissance concentrations of azagly-nafaréline circulating cells , lasting up to 12 months is observed . 
the apparent volume of distribution of azagly-nafaréline after intravenous administration to a dose , equivalent to the contents of a implant is 0,12 l / kg .

the treatment in proœ supprimera strus do not flush ongoing ( proœ strus and face strus ) . 
in females adults , flush induites are usuellement observed in the first month after the first administration of implant . 
the frequency of flush induites is lower when the first treatment is administered as métœ strus ( 32 ) rather than anœ strus ( 84 ) . 
therefore , the first treatment should be given preferably in métœ strus . 
the incidence of flush induites after administration of a new treatment to chiennes who did not show signs status strus after previous administration of the medicinal product is estimated to be very low ( 8 ) . 
the risk of induction of flush fertiles is small in métœ strus ( 5 ) . 
the administration of Gonazon to other stages of the cycle may cause flush may be fertiles . 
if a chienne becomes pregnant after flush induites , there may be resorption embryonal and spontaneous . 
therefore , if females is eyesight as touch , heat with male should be avoided until the foam any evidence of flush ( swelling vulvaire , bleeding and attraction male ) . 
the flush induites are not observed if treatment is started prior to the onset of puberty . 
in addition , the frequency of flush induites was smaller in young female more than in the elderly . 
some of the chiennes with flush induites may the develop a pseudogestation .
