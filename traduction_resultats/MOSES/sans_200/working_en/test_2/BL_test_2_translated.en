hypersensitivity to the active substance , to arachides or soya or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average dose 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
however , the clinical experience 
49 the olanzapine is limited in patients with disease associated , caution is recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
50 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take these tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
51 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents .

other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
56 Il no specific antidote for overdose of olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other bêta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
57 Chez patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
58 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
59 Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

in this patient population , an age than 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , disease 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
64 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
65 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take these tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
66 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other bêta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
72 Chez patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
73 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
74 Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
mutagenicity 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .

however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
however , the clinical experience 
79 the olanzapine is limited in patients with disease associated , caution is recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
80 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take these tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
81 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 1.69mmol / l- &lt; 2.26mmol / l ) to values levels ( 2.26mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 Au clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences 
patients had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol to dose comparable . 
in the absence of information on the precise history of abnormal movements extrapyramidaux of acute or dyskinesia , it cannot reached at this day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes extrapyramidaux tardifs . 
7 Des acute symptoms such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Des evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
use capsules ( at least 48 weeks ) La proportion of patients who experienced adverse changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol levels / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
further information on special populations Au clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an excess of death and events accidents compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
an abnormal gait disturbance feeling cold and falls were adverse events very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
interstitial , body temperature increased , lethargy , erythema , visual hallucinations and of urinary incontinences have been observed commonly . 
in clinical trials menés in patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported , and more frequently , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial conducted in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; contributif factor potential may be plasma high valproate . 
increased greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
85 Au within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) . 
metabolism and nutrition disorders Très common :

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the beginning of treatment ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other bêta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
88 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
89 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. Olanzapine Comment Neopharma been studied ? 
it is considered a antipsychotic medicine atypique different as it is of other antipsychotic more anciens , available on holder since the years 1950 . 
it is suggested that the effect of benefit of olanzapine is due to its effect blocking on the receptors of neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine ( also called serotonin ) and dopamine . 
since these neurotransmitters are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , olanzapine helps size activity and brain and reduce the symptoms of these diseases . 
Quelles studies have been conducted on Olanzapine Neopharma ? 
olanzapine Neopharma is a medicine générique , studies confined to trials targeting to show bioequivalence with the reference medicine ( i. e. the fact that the two medicines occur similar levels of the active substance in the body ) . 
what benefit demonstrated by Olanzapine Neopharma during the studies ? 
Etant given that Olanzapine Neopharma is a medicine générique and that it is bioequivalent to the reference medicine , the benefit and its risk are presented as is the same as those of the reference medicine . 
why has Neopharma Olanzapine been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( CHMP ) concluded that , because of the european Union requirements , Olanzapine Neopharma is manifestement comparable , site sight qualitatif , and to be bioequivalent to Zyprexa . 
the CHMP has therefore that , as for Zyprexa , the benefit / risk is observed . 
the committee recommended be given marketing authorisation holder for Olanzapine Neopharma .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine may be 
2 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age than 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
4 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors ( vte ) , any factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
rare cases of 
5 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
6 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
10 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the beginning of treatment ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in overall proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
14 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine may be 
18 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age than 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
20 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors ( vte ) , any factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
rare cases of 
21 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
22 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
26 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the beginning of treatment ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in overall proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
30 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
reproductive toxicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
mutagenicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity D&apos; after results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine may be 
34 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age than 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
36 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors ( vte ) , any factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
rare cases of 
37 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
38 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 1.69 mmol / l- &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to values levels ( 2.26 mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 Au clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol to dose comparable . 
in the absence of information on the precise history of abnormal movements extrapyramidaux of acute or dyskinesia , it cannot reached at this day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes extrapyramidaux tardifs . 
7 Des acute symptoms such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Des evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare .

increased greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
42 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the beginning of treatment ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in overall proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
46 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
reproductive toxicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
mutagenicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity D&apos; after results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
51 Des events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
52 Fonction hepatic Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors ( vte ) , any factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
53 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
54 potential Effets the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
58 Une clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the beginning of treatment ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
59 Traitement of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in overall proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
61 L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 62 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
reproductive toxicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
mutagenicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity D&apos; after results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine may be 
65 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age than 65 years , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or concomitant use of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
67 recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors ( vte ) , any factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
rare cases of 
68 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , Lapp lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
69 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

increased levels of triglycerides fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 1.69 mmol / l- &lt; 2.26 mmol / l ) to values levels ( 2.26 mmol / l ) was very common . 
6 Au clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol to dose comparable . 
in the absence of information on the precise history of abnormal movements extrapyramidaux of acute or dyskinesia , it cannot reached at this day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes extrapyramidaux tardifs . 
7 Des acute symptoms such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
8 Des evidence associated with ( such gynaecomastia , galactorrhée and pressure mammaire ) have been rare . 
in most patients , the levels of prolactine is are normalisés without interruption of treatment . 
use capsules ( at least 48 weeks ) La proportion of patients who experienced adverse changes clinically significant weight ( increase ) , glucose , total cholesterol levels / HDL / LDL or triglycerides increased over time . 
in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
further information on special populations Au clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an excess of death and events accidents compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
an abnormal gait disturbance feeling cold and falls were adverse events very commonly reported with olanzapine . 
in a clinical trial conducted in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; contributif factor potential may be plasma high valproate . 
increased greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
73 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 10 ) , common ( 1 and &lt; 10 ) .

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the beginning of treatment ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) was frequently . 
changes total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the beginning of treatment ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant high ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of olanzapine . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in overall proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
77 between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
reproductive toxicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
mutagenicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity D&apos; after results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
4 Fonction hepatic Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
5 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- Lapp malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
6 Effets potential of olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects 
the list of side effects presented in the table has been established from the collect of adverse events and laboratory tests from the notification spontaneous and clinical trials .

6 Au clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol to dose comparable . 
in the absence of information on the precise history of abnormal movements extrapyramidaux of acute or dyskinesia , it cannot reached at this day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes extrapyramidaux tardifs . 
7 Des acute symptoms such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine .

in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
further information on special populations Au clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an excess of death and events accidents compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
in a clinical trial conducted in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; contributif factor potential may be plasma high valproate . 
increased greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
12 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in overall proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
13 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
14 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
15 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
18 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
19 Des events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipidiquesDes administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
20 symptoms suggesting of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicines potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported during concomitant use of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
21 Hypotension Une postural postural hypotension was rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- Lapp malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects

PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
29 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
30 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
31 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
35 Des events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergiqueBien activity than the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
36 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms features suggestive of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicines potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
37 postural Hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- Lapp malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur . 
undesirable effects

6 Au clinical trials , the incidence of general parkinsoniens and dystonies in the olanzapine was numerically greater than that of placebo ( no statistical differences significant ) . 
patients had a lower incidence of general parkinsoniens , akathisia and dystonie that patients treated with haloperidol to dose comparable . 
in the absence of information on the precise history of abnormal movements extrapyramidaux of acute or dyskinesia , it cannot reached at this day that the olanzapine leads to less than dyskinésies tardives and / or syndromes extrapyramidaux tardifs . 
7 Des acute symptoms such sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea and vomiting have been reported with abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine .

in adult patients who have follow-up 9 -12 months of treatment , the rate of increase of the mean blood glucose decreased after 4-6 months approximately . 
further information on special populations Au clinical trials in elderly patients déments , treatment with olanzapine has been associated with an excess of death and events accidents compared to placebo ( see section 4.4 ) . 
in a clinical trial conducted in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; contributif factor potential may be plasma high valproate . 
increased greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
44 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
45 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
46 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
47 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
51 Des events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic autraitement . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
52 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms features suggestive of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicines potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
53 postural Hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- Lapp malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interaction consideration is expected as this could be 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in a clinical trial conducted in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; contributif factor potential may be plasma high valproate . 
increased greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
60 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
in a study in patients receiving lithium or valproate for at least two weeks , the introduction of 10 mg of olanzapine ( in 
61 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
62 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
63 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
67 Des events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
68 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms features suggestive of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicines potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
69 postural Hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- Lapp malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interaction consideration is expected as this could be 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
76 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
77 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
78 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
79 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
83 Des events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
84 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms features suggestive of hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with medicines potentially hepatotoxic . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
85 Hypotension Une postural postural hypotension was rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- Lapp malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine there were no treatment-related significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interaction consideration is expected as this could be 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
92 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
93 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
94 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
repeat-dose toxicity 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
ci prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine may be 
98 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , juice , milk or pomme chew ) immediately before administration . 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dosage and frequency of administration of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should use Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant was 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
101 emboliques venous , any factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , orodispersible tablet , contains the tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) , which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
clinical 102 are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
103 Dans a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
108 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the tablets tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
110 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , juice , milk or pomme chew ) immediately before administration . 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dosage and frequency of administration of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see ruvrique 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should use Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
116 Anomalies lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
117 general Activité the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
in studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of treatment-emergent dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
118 L&apos; mean the ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
124 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the tablets tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
126 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
130 Le Olanzapine orodispersible tablet Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , juice , milk or pomme chew ) immediately before administration . 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dosage and frequency of administration of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see ruvrique 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should use Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
132 lipid Anomalies Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
133 Activité general on the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of treatment-emergent dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
yellow orangé S ( E110 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , orodispersible tablet contains of yellow orangé S ( E110 ) , which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
134 Inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a assistance 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other bêta-sympathomimétique because the stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated of efficacy results comparable haloperidol in overall proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the tablets tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
Chez i.e. healthy volunteers elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness to maintain this improvement term . 
the olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who already responded to treatment with the olanzapine in a mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg daily once monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients treated with olanzapine in a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on clinical judgement between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
increased at doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that after a appropriate clinical reassessment and should generally be considered at intervals from 24 hours minimum . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of olanzapine . 
Olanzapine orodispersible tablet Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , juice , milk or pomme chew ) immediately before administration . 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dosage and frequency of administration of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; use of the olanzapine in children and adolescents below 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years and over when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
hepatic insufficiency ( cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in the not smoking compared to smoking . 
the blood more than one factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may substantiate a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase dose will be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should use Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the patient &apos;s clinical improvement may take several days even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
the higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( mean daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was than olanzapine ( compared to placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as cerebrovascular accident , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times more adverse events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo-treated who experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors of adverse events accidents in the olanzapine . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of the olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be chronic schizophrenia at the start of study with the minimal effective dose treatment anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and continue the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the initial the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
Malin of syndrome Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
rare cases reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under olanzapine . 
clinical signs of SMN are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status , and signs of neuro-végétative instability ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart beat ) . 
may include signs such as elevated of CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus De rare hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , with a fatal outcome for some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a factor prédisposant has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
two lipid Anomalies Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with olanzapine during placebo-controlled clinical trials ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as necessary evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergique activity Bien that the olanzapine has shown a anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of effects related to this activity was minimal in clinical trials . 
liver function Des elevations transient and asymptomatic transaminases ( ALAT and ASAT ) have been commonly observed particularly at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed and possibly follow-up reduction adjustment . 
in situations where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia have been commonly reported when concomitant administration of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) when abrupt treatment discontinuation by olanzapine . 
Des with thromboembolic injury thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and treatment with olanzapine . 
however schizophrenia patients with often risk factors venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
149 general Activité the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu main effects of olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with medicinal products with centrally acting and with alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , the olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of direct agonists and indirect dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in general may lower their level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with olanzapine . 
in most of these cases , it were either history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
tardive dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration lower or equal to one year , the occurrence of treatment-emergent dyskinésies was significantly lower in the olanzapine . 
however the risk of any tardive dyskinesia increasing with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une postural hypotension has been rarely observed in elderly patients in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended that measure periodically pressure patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13-17 years have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in metabolic parameters and elevations blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the blister should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of the olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations . 
only a increase mild to moderate clearance of the olanzapine was observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are limited , but clinical monitoring is recommended and an increase in the dosage of the olanzapine may be considered , if necessary ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits significantly the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
150 L&apos; mean the ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
an initial lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving fluvoxamine or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of the olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after administration of the olanzapine . 
with fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium , magnesium ) or cimetidine , there were no treatment-related relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser the direct effects and indirect dopaminergic agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was apparent in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after initiation of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicines dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and psychosis is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the range QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , the experience in women is limited , olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy and somnolence have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated about 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
breast-feeding is therefore recommended to patients during treatment with olanzapine . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of somnolence and dizziness , patients should be advised on this risk when the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in clinical trials menés in patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) , an aggravation of symptoms parkinsonienne and hallucinations have been very commonly reported , and more frequently , than with placebo . 
in a clinical trial conducted in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , when the concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia was 4.1 ; contributif factor potential may be plasma high valproate . 
increased greater than 10 cases of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing adolescents to adults has been conducted , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table are summarised side effects reported with a greater frequency in patients adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure comparable . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who had increased weight clinically significant were larger in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in a exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , agitation / aggression , dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , seizures , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 cases of overdose ) and discontinuation cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported for of experience at a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the bioavailability of oral the olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of compromising vital functions should be based on the condition , including treatment hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
- 156 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued until the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , treatment with a wide antimaniaque and thymorégulateur pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies of behaviour in animals have shown a systems antagonisme 5HT , dopaminergic and cholinergic , which support the profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in studies in vitro the olanzapine possesses greater affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 that for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared with D2 models . 
it has been demonstrated by studies électrophysiologiques that reduced olanzapine selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic of system modulates ( A10 ) while the effect observed on the system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of évitement packed , which may indicate test antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , the olanzapine increases the response to a test of &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers using a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant differences in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo were observed in the main measure of assessment of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes levels fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
olanzapine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the tablets tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide ; it do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent substance , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age and gender . 
158 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in young patients . 
in 44 patients schizophrenia and aged over 65 years , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with an adverse reactions profile . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) showed a safety profile comparable in women ( n = 467 ) and in humans ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif were excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in the not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and clearance was reduced ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in the not smoking that in smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of the olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , showed no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
differences démographiques between adolescents and adult applies to a mean weight below and a least important of smoking in adolescents . 
such factors may contribute to observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and decreased weight gain . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( mouse ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs have tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
clinical signs observed were as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor and fast of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at doses beyond , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and peripheral haematological disorders . 
a safety appeared for depression of SNC . 
growth parameters were reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible related to the increased prolactinémie in pregnant rats included decrease the weight of cancers and the utérus , changes morphologiques vaginal epithelium and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of species , including reductions dose-dépendantes number of circulating leucocytes in mice and a decrease non-specific circulating leukocytes in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow has been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no teratogenic effects . 
the sedation was any effect on the ability of impair mating of male . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , delayed foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of activity small have been observed . 
the olanzapine showed no effect mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation tests bacterial tests , and in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu that the olanzapine is not carcinogenicity .

Omnitrope is a biosimilar &apos;medicine : defined , Omnitrope is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the european Union ( UE ) and contains the same active substance ( also known as the reference medicine ) . 
the reference medicine for Omnitrope is Genotropin . 
for more information on biosimilar medicines , see the document rassemblant questions and answers here . 
what is Omnitrope used for ? 
diagnosis should be confirmed by a genetic test appropriate . 
Omnitrope is also used in adults with administration deficiency growth hormone , as replacement therapy . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how to Omnitrope used for ? 
treatment with Omnitrope should be followed by a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with visual growth . 
Omnitrope is given by injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) , once daily , at bedtime . 
the patient or the soignant may inject top Omnitrope , after receiving advice formation of a doctor or a ( e ) nurse . 
cartridges of Omnitrope should be used only with a specially of injection specifically designed to this medicine .

the dose may be adjusted by the following depending on the change in the body weight and the response . 
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel . 
how to Omnitrope been studied ? 
the active substance of Omnitrope , the somatropine , is identical to the growth hormone human . 
it is produced by a method known as recombinant of ADN technology : the hormone is made by a bacterium that has received a gene ( ADN ) , which makes it able to produce . 
Omnitrope replaces the natural hormone . 
Quelles studies have been conducted with Omnitrope ? 
Omnitrope was studied to show that it is comparable to the reference medicine , Genotropin . 
Omnitrope was compared to Genotropin in 89 children with deficiency growth hormone and have not received treatment . 
the study lasted nine months ; measures height , at the start and at the end of the study , and the rate of growth , during the study , have been performed . 
to study the safety of Omnitrope , this medicine has been administered to 51 other children during one year in older . 
what benefit demonstrated by Omnitrope during the studies ? 
after nine months , the Omnitrope and Genotropin increases have to be similar in size and growth rate ( equivalent to an increase in 10.7 cm per year with the two medicines ) . 
therefore , it has been shown that Omnitrope is as effective as Genotropin . 
what is the risk associated with Omnitrope ? 
the side effects reported with Omnitrope were type and severity similar to those observed with the reference medicine , Genotropin . 
in addition , as with all herbal protein , some patients may develop antibodies ( proteins produced in response to Omnitrope ) . 
however , these antibodies have no effect on the inhibitor . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with the use of Omnitrope , see the package leaflet . 
Omnitrope should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to the somatropine or to any of the other ingredients ( the solution ready for use and the solvent of Omnitrope 5 mg / ml contain the benzyl alcohol ) . 
Omnitrope should not be used when the patient experiences a tumour active acute disease life-threatening . 
for a full list of restrictions , see the package leaflet . 
the somatropine is anticipated to interfere with the use area of insulin . 
blood sugar levels should be monitored during treatment and it may also be necessary to adjust therapy with insulin or in add a . 
why has Omnitrope been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( CHMP ) decided , according to requirements of UE , whether Omnitrope pose profile of quality , safety and efficacy comparable to that of Genotropin . 
the CHMP is therefore of the opinion that , as for Genotropin , the benefit of this medicine is the risk that it produces . 
Quelles are the measures taken to ensure the safe use of Omnitrope ? 
the measures taken to ensure the safe use without breath of Omnitrope are related to grounds use the medicine .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
infants , children and adolescents 
- Retard of growth bound to somatotrope deficiency 
- growth Retard related to a syndrome of Turner 
- Retard of growth associated with chronic renal failure . 
- Retard of growth ( height current &lt; -2,5 score SDS ( standard deviation ) and size parentale 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by the genetic test appropriate . 
adults 
- Traitement replacement in adults with severe somatotrope deficiency . 
patients 
with somatotrope severe iatrogenic immunosuppression deficiency in adulthood are defined as who disease hypothalamo-hypophysaire known and at least one other hormone deficiency hypophysaire , except that of the prolactine . 
a single test dynamic should be performed to diagnostiquer or exclure deficiency growth hormone in these patients . 
the limits dynamiques tests should be swallowed defined . 
posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
the dosage and regimen of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were used . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
children with the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year and including the épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
retardation growth in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses may be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of treatment ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 DS . 
the recommended doses in paediatric patients :

growth hormone deficiency in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually depending on the requirement , determined by the levels of IGF-1 yielding concentrations IGF-1 , depending on age , do not cut 2 DS . 
patients with haemoglobin IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should receive the growth hormone until levels of sufficiently IGF-1 within the normal range , without exceed 2 DS . 
the clinical response in the same as undesirable effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increased sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate with oestrogen , are sous-dosées while men are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment of somatotrope hormone should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
3 L&apos; injection should be subcutaneous and the injection site should vary to avoid the onset of lipoatrophies . 
instructions for use and handling see section 6.6 . 
Contre-indications 
- Hypersensibilité to the somatropine or any of the excipients . 
- La somatropine should not be used if tumour in activity and any treatment 
antitumour should be completed before instituting therapy . 
- La somatropine should not be used to support the growth of patients whose 
- Les patients experiencing acute critique have complications being secondary to a 
surgery to beat opened abdominal surgery , a polytraumatisme , a acute respiratory failure , or situation similar should not be treated by the growth hormone . 
for patients receiving treatment for conversion , refer to section 4.4 . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine may cause an resistance as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes could be established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , it may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and an increase in serum concentrations in T3 . 
in general , the peripheral levels of thyroid hormones are in reference current healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on haemoglobin thyroid hormones may have a clinical consequences in patients with hypothyroidism infraclinique central in which a hypothyroidism may theoretically develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is therefore particularly advised control thyroid function by initiation of treatment with the somatropine and after dose adjustment . 
decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this may be related to changes in transport proteins or increased hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of somatotrope deficiency secondary to treatment antitumour , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with endocrine disorders , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe or repeated paid , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of oeil to dépister for swelling papillaire . 
if it is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , products , if appropriate , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
4 recommend the continued treatment with the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
however , the clinical experience showed that the réintroduction treatment was often possible without récurrence intracranial of hypertension . 
if treatment with the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of symptoms hypertension intracranial is necessary . 
in patients aged over 60 years , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be associated with a energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with syndrome , a Prader- Willi titration signs of occlusion airway , apnoea sleeping or infection breathing , should be performed . 
in case of signs of occlusion airway , the problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea sleeping should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with methods reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during at , and monitored if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of occlusion airway ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment of system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea sleeping is suspected . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infections , which should be diagnosed also précocement as possible and treated effectively . 
all patients with syndrome Prader-Willi should also be monitoring pondéral prior to and during treatment with the growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop in a rapid growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of the scoliose during treatment with the growth hormone . 
experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before instituting therapy then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a test hyperglycaemia cause orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical develops , the growth hormone should not be administered . 
5 Chez children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to measure the levels of IGF-l prior to initiating therapy , and thereafter 2 times per year . 
if on measures repeated , the rate of IGF-l &apos;s benefits are greater than 2 DS compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
experience with respect to the initiation of treatment just before the onset of puberty in children neonates are small for gestational age is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy just before the onset of puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final size are reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal prior to initiating therapy . 
to be confirmed delayed of growth , it is growth should be followed in the past during one year before start treatment . 
during this period , treatment of renal insufficiency ( including control of the acidosis , hyperparathyroïdie and steady nutritionnel ) should have been initiated and should be held for the duration of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued if kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent impairment patients with chronic renal failure receiving Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated by the somatropine . 
Etant given the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients experiencing acute critique , benefits of continuing treatment in this situation should be shown balance with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a condition acute critique other or similar , the benefit possible treatment by the somatropine balance should be shown with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of a interaction studies performed in adults with deficiency growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome p450 isoenzymes P450 . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical consequence of this effect is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and to the section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there is no clinical experience of therapy in pregnant women . 
experimental data about the animal reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in pregnancy . 
in a pregnancy normal , the rate of growth hormone hypophysaire decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the hormone 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary when low in growth hormone in women for the q3 pregnancy . 
it is not known that the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption intestinal protein in the child is very unlikely . 
particular attention should be paid when Omnitrope is administered to women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects of on the ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
decrease of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with deficiency growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is initiated , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as rigidity peripheral oedema , extremities , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these effects are uncommon severe to moderate , they occur in the first months of therapy and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and to age patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of growth hormone deficiency . 
in paediatric patients , such side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leucémies have been reported in paediatric patients atteintsd&apos; deficiency growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency appears similar to those in children with no deficiency growth hormone . 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine caused antibody formation in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low , and their formation was of no clinical evidence . 
Affections hypothyroidism 
type 2 diabetes . 
Affections nervous system disorders

in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing azotée retention , in stimulating the growth of muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases the lipolysis and decreases influx of triglycerides within adequate lipid of the body . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentrations IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties were evident . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of receptors hepatic of LDL-cholestérol , and change the lipid profile lipoproteins and serum . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with growth hormone deficiency results in decreased serum LDL and apolipoprotéines B . 
a decrease in total cholesterol in the serum may also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting is generally unchanged . 
children with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated by administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the growth hormone deficiency is associated with a decrease in plasma and volumes extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine ensures a potassium and sodium retention , phosphorique . 
bone metabolism : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density at sites body loading increase after a administration long-term somatropine to patients with deficiency growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
ability physical : 
the strength muscle and the ability to exercise are améliorées after a long-term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also the heart rate , but the mechanism has has 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational laboratory of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used until the final size . 
data from published studies suggest an late 0.5 DS in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety information is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption La bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
ELIMINATION La a half life of the mean terminal somatropine is approximately 0.4 hour after administration intra- venous to adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope powder and solvent for solution for injection , the half-life achieved 3 hours . 
sous-population La bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in patients male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to obtain complete information about . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no toxicity studies subaiguë and local tolerance with Omnitrope have revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no other general toxicology studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the in vitro genotoxicity studies and in vivo on the genetic mutation and induction of chromosomal aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
it has been observed chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients after long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of this data is not clear . 
in another study , it has not been where differences chromosomal in lymphocytes patients who had been treated with the long-term somatropine .

- growth Retard related to a syndrome of Turner . 
- Retard of growth associated with chronic renal failure . 
- Retard of growth ( height current &lt; - &lt; -2,5 score SDS ( standard deviation ) and size 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by the genetic test appropriate . 
adults 
- Traitement replacement in adults with severe somatotrope deficiency . 
patients 
with somatotrope severe iatrogenic immunosuppression deficiency in adulthood are defined as who disease hypothalamo-hypophysaire known and at least one other hormone deficiency hypophysaire , except the prolactine . 
a single test dynamic should be performed to diagnostiquer or exclure deficiency growth hormone in these patients . 
the limits dynamiques tests should be swallowed defined . 
posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
the dosage and regimen of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were used . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
paediatric patients including the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year and including the épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
retardation growth in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses may be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of treatment ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 DS .

growth hormone deficiency in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually depending on the requirement , determined by the levels of IGF-1 yielding concentrations IGF-1 , depending on age , do not cut 2 DS . 
patients with haemoglobin IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should receive the growth hormone until levels of sufficiently IGF-1 within the normal range , without exceed 2 DS . 
the clinical response in the same as undesirable effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increased sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate with oestrogen , are sous-dosées while men are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment of somatotrope hormone should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
the injection should be subcutaneous and the injection site should vary to avoid the onset of lipoatrophies .

Contre-indications 
- Hypersensibilité to the somatropine or any of the excipients . 
- La somatropine should not be used if tumour in activity and any treatment 
antitumour should be completed before instituting therapy . 
- La somatropine should not be used to support the growth of children including the

special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine may cause an resistance as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes could be established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , it may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and an increase in serum concentrations in T3 . 
in general , the peripheral levels of thyroid hormones are in reference current healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on haemoglobin thyroid hormones may have a clinical consequences in patients with hypothyroidism infraclinique central in which a hypothyroidism may theoretically develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is therefore particularly advised control thyroid function by initiation of treatment with the somatropine and after dose adjustment . 
decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this may be related to changes in transport proteins or increased hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope 
in case of somatotrope deficiency secondary to treatment antitumour , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with rare endocriniens , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe or repeated paid , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of oeil to dépister for swelling papillaire . 
if it is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , products , if appropriate , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
the present time do not recommend the continued treatment with the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
if treatment 
14 by the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of symptoms hypertension intracranial is necessary . 
in patients aged over 60 years , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be associated with a energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with syndrome , a Prader- Willi titration signs of occlusion airway , apnoea sleeping or infection breathing , should be performed . 
in case of signs of occlusion airway , the problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea sleeping should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with methods reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during at , and monitored if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of occlusion airway ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment of system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea sleeping is suspected . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infections , which should be diagnosed also précocement as possible and treated effectively . 
all patients with syndrome Prader-Willi should also be monitoring pondéral prior to and during treatment with the growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop in a rapid growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of the scoliose during treatment with the growth hormone . 
experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before instituting therapy then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a test hyperglycaemia cause orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical develops , the growth hormone should not be administered . 
if on measures repeated , 
15 of IGF-l &apos;s benefits are greater than 2 DS compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
experience with respect to the initiation of treatment just before the onset of puberty in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy just before the onset of puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children neonates are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final size are reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal prior to initiating therapy . 
to be confirmed delayed of growth , it is growth should be followed in the past during one year before start treatment . 
during this period , treatment of renal insufficiency ( including control of the acidosis , hyperparathyroïdie and steady nutritionnel ) should have been initiated and should be held for the duration of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued if kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent impairment patients with chronic renal failure receiving Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated by the somatropine . 
Etant given the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients experiencing acute critique , benefits of continuing treatment in this situation should be shown balance with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a condition acute critique other or similar , the benefit possible treatment by the somatropine balance should be shown with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
due to the presence of benzyl alcohol , this medicinal product must not be given to prématurés nor to either . 
it may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children less than 3 years . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of a interaction studies performed in adults with deficiency growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome p450 isoenzymes P450 . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical consequence of this effect is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and to the section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there is no clinical experience of therapy in pregnant women . 
experimental data about the animal reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in pregnancy . 
16 Lors pregnancy normal , the rate of growth hormone hypophysaire decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the growth hormone placental to approximately 30 weeks . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary when low in growth hormone in women for the q3 pregnancy . 
it is not known if the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
particular attention should be paid when Omnitrope is given to women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
decrease of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with deficiency growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is initiated , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as rigidity peripheral oedema , extremities , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these effects are uncommon severe to moderate , they occur in the first months of therapy and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and to age patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of growth hormone deficiency . 
in paediatric patients , such side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leucémies have been reported in paediatric patients with deficiency growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency appears similar to those in children with no growth hormone deficiency 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine caused antibody formation in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low , and their formation was of no clinical evidence . 
Affections hypothyroidism 
type 2 diabetes . 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
uncommon : 
paraesthesia in adulte. of the syndrome carpien in adults ; paraesthesia in the patient pédiatrique. intracranial hypertension bénigne . 
Affections musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
common : 
rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in adults . 
uncommon : rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in paediatric patients . 
general disorders and administration site 
common : 
skin reactions focal passagères and injection site in paediatric patients . 
uncommon : 
oedema peripheral in paediatric patients . 
overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia , then preoperative secondarily to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , long-term , lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of excess of growth hormone in humans .

patients with haemoglobin IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should receive the growth hormone until levels of sufficiently IGF-1 within the normal range , without exceed 2 DS . 
the clinical response in the same as undesirable effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1.0 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increased sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens , are sous-dosées while men are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment of somatotrope hormone should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , dose reduction is possible .

special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine may cause an resistance as well as hyperglycaemia in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes could be established following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , it may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration in T4 and an increase in serum concentrations in T3 . 
in general , the peripheral levels of thyroid hormones are in reference current healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on haemoglobin thyroid hormones may have a clinical consequences in patients with hypothyroidism infraclinique central in which a hypothyroidism may theoretically develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is therefore particularly advised control thyroid function by initiation of treatment with the somatropine and after dose adjustment . 
decrease of serum cortisol levels has been reported with the somatropine ; this may be related to changes in transport proteins or increased hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of somatotrope deficiency secondary to treatment antitumour , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with rare endocriniens , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequently than in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe or repeated paid , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of eye to dépister for oedema papillaire . 
if it is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , products , if appropriate , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
24 recommend the continued treatment with the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
however , the clinical experience showed that the réintroduction treatment was often possible without récurrence intracranial of hypertension . 
if treatment with the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of symptoms hypertension intracranial is necessary . 
in patients aged over 60 years , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be associated with a energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting the somatropine in patients with syndrome , a Prader- Willi titration signs of occlusion airway , apnoea sleeping or infection breathing , should be performed . 
in case of signs of occlusion airway , the problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the growth hormone . 
the apnoea sleeping should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with methods reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during at , and monitored if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of occlusion airway ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment of system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea sleeping is suspected . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infections , which should be diagnosed also précocement as possible and treated effectively . 
all patients with syndrome Prader-Willi should also be monitoring pondéral prior to and during treatment with the growth hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a Prader-Willi syndrome . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop in a rapid growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of the scoliose during treatment with the growth hormone . 
experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before instituting therapy then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a test hyperglycaemia cause orally should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical develops , the growth hormone should not be administered . 
25 Chez children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to measure the levels of IGF-l prior to initiating therapy , and thereafter 2 times per year . 
if on measures repeated , the rate of IGF-l &apos;s benefits are greater than 2 DS compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
experience with respect to the initiation of treatment just before the onset of puberty in children neonates are small for gestational age is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy just before the onset of puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final size are reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal . 
prior to initiating therapy , to be confirmed delayed of growth , it is growth should be followed in the past during one year before start treatment . 
during this period , treatment of renal insufficiency ( including control of the acidosis , hyperparathyroïdie and steady nutritionnel ) should have been initiated and should be held for the duration of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued if kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent impairment patients with chronic renal failure receiving Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated by the somatropine . 
Etant given the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients experiencing acute critique , benefits of continuing treatment in this situation should be shown balance with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a condition acute critique other or similar , the benefit possible treatment by the somatropine balance should be shown with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
due to the presence of benzyl alcohol , this medicinal product must not be given to prématurés nor to either . 
it may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children less than 3 years . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of a interaction studies performed in adults with deficiency growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome p450 isoenzymes P450 . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical consequence of this effect is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and to the section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there are no data on the use of this product in pregnant women . 
experimental data about the animal reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in pregnancy . 
in a pregnancy normal , the rate of growth hormone hypophysaire decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the growth hormone placental to approximately 30 weeks . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary when low in growth hormone in women for the q3 pregnancy . 
it is not known if the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
Omnitrope should only be given with caution in women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
decrease of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with deficiency growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is initiated , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects related to fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these effects are uncommon severe to moderate , they occur in the first months of therapy and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these adverse events is related to the administered dose and to age patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of growth hormone deficiency . 
in paediatric patients , such side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leucémies have been reported in paediatric patients with deficiency growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency appears similar to those in children with no deficiency growth hormone . 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine resulted in the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low and their formation was of no clinical evidence . 
Affections hypothyroidism 
type 2 diabetes . 
Affections nervous system disorders

overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia , then preoperative secondarily to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , long-term , lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of excess of growth hormone in humans . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : hormones of antéhypophyse and analogues . 
atc ATC : 
the somatropine is a potent jouant metabolic hormone play an important in the metabolism of lipid , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with deficiency growth hormone . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing azotée retention , in stimulating the growth of muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentrations IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties were evident . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of receptors hepatic of LDL-cholestérol , and change the lipid profile lipoproteins and serum . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with growth hormone deficiency results in decreased serum LDL and apolipoprotéines B . 
a decrease in total cholesterol in the serum may also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting is generally unchanged . 
children with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated by administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the growth hormone deficiency is associated with a decrease in plasma and volumes extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine ensures a potassium and sodium retention , phosphorique . 
28 Métabolisme bone : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density at sites body loading increase after a administration long-term somatropine to patients with deficiency growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
ability physical : 
the strength muscle and the ability to exercise are améliorées after a long-term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also the heart rate , but the mechanism has not been elucidated . 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational laboratory of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used until the final size . 
data from published studies suggest an late 0.5 DS in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety information is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption La bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
after subcutaneous administration of a dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope headache general disorders mg / ml solution for injection to healthy adult of Cmax and tmax values are 157 72 28 g / l and 4.0 2.0 hours . 
ELIMINATION La a half life of the mean terminal somatropine is approximately 0.4 hour after administration intra- venous to adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope headache general disorders mg / ml solution for injection , the half-life achieved 3 hours . 
sous-population La bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in patients in male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to obtain complete information about . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no toxicity studies subaiguë and local tolerance with Omnitrope have revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no other general toxicology studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the in vitro genotoxicity studies and in vivo on the genetic mutation and induction of chromosomal aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
it has been observed chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients after long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of this data is not clear . 
in another study , it has not been where differences chromosomal in lymphocytes patients who had been treated with the long-term somatropine .

PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : hormones of antéhypophyse and analogues . 
atc ATC : 
the somatropine is a potent jouant metabolic hormone play an important in the metabolism of lipid , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates the growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with deficiency growth hormone . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing azotée retention , in stimulating the growth of muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases the lipolysis and decreases influx of triglycerides within adequate lipid of the body . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentrations IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties were evident . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of receptors hepatic of LDL-cholestérol , and change the lipid profile lipoproteins and serum . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with growth hormone deficiency results in decreased serum LDL and apolipoprotéines B . 
a decrease in total cholesterol in the serum may also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but fasting is generally unchanged . 
children with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated by administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the growth hormone deficiency is associated with a decrease in plasma and volumes extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine ensures a potassium and sodium retention , phosphorique . 
bone metabolism : 
the somatropine stimulates the renewal bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density at sites body loading increase after a administration long-term somatropine to patients with deficiency growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
ability physical : 
the strength muscle and the ability to exercise are améliorées after a long-term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also the heart rate , but the mechanism has 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational laboratory of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used until the final size . 
data from published studies suggest an late 0.5 DS in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety information is still limited . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption La bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
after subcutaneous administration of a dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope from Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection to healthy adult of Cmax and tmax values are 157 74 22 g / l and 3.9 1.2 hours . 
ELIMINATION La a half life of the mean terminal somatropine is approximately 0.4 hour after administration intra- venous to adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection , the half-life achieved 3 hours . 
sous-population La bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in patients in male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to obtain complete information about . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no toxicity studies subaiguë and local tolerance with Omnitrope have revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no other general toxicology studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the in vitro genotoxicity studies and in vivo on the genetic mutation and induction of chromosomal aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
it has been observed chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro on lymphocytes collected in patients after long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of this data is not clear . 
in another study , it has not been where differences chromosomal in lymphocytes patients who had been treated with the long-term somatropine .

how to Onsenal been studied ? 
the active substance of Onsenal , the célécoxib , is an non-stéroïdien ( AINS ) that belongs to the group inhibitors cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
the célécoxib blocks the enzyme COX-2 , which has for effect a reduction of the production of prostaglandins , substances that 
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. activities in process such as inflammation and the activity of the muscle plain ( muscle which effectue tasks automatiques as opening and closure of the blood vessels ) . 
Quelles Onsenal studies have been studied ? 
Onsenal has been studied in one main study involving 83 adults with FAP , in whom the effectiveness of two doses of Onsenal was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) . 
in the study , 25 patients had a colon ( lower intestine ) intact , but other had undergone a ablation surgery some or of the colon . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of polyps in an area defined wall colon or rectum after six months of treatment . 
an additional study was reproduction on the effects of Onsenal in 18 children with FAP . 
what benefit demonstrated by Onsenal during the studies ? 
Onsenal , at a dose of 400 mg twice daily , was more effective than placebo . 
in adults , Onsenal was reduce the number mean polyps 28 after six months , whereas their number had decreased 5 in placebo-treated patients . 
Onsenal has also reduces the number of polyps in children with FAP . 
what is the risk associated with Onsenal ? 
undesirable effects the most commonly observed under Onsenal ( in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and diarrhoea . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with Onsenal , see the package leaflet . 
Onsenal should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to célécoxib , any some of the other ingredients , or sulphonamides ( such as certain antibiotic ) . 
Onsenal should not be used in pregnant women or which may become in the absence of contraception nor to women who are breastfeeding . 
it must not be given to patients with severe liver disease or kidney , to patients with a disease causing inflammation of the gut or for patients with some problems affecting the heart or the blood vessels . 
for a full list of restrictions , see the package leaflet . 
why has Onsenal been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( CHMP ) decided that Onsenal &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for the reduction in the number of polyps mouth adénomateux in patients with FAP in addition to the surgery and monitoring endoscopique . 
the committee noted that no effect of a decreased number of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of developing a cancer of the intestine has been demonstrated . 
the committee recommended be given marketing authorisation holder for Onsenal .

Onsenal 200 mg hard capsules 
statement QUALITATIVE ET QUANTITATIVE 
each capsule contains 200 mg célécoxib . 
for excipients , see section 6.1 . 
PHARMACEUTIQUE form 
Gélules capsule white , opaque with two bandes dorées indicating 7767 and 200 . 
CLINIQUES data 
therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( PAF ) , in combination with the surgery and in addition to standard endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of reducing the number and size of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use and 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is two capsules of 200 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 Propriétés Contre-indications pharmacokinetic ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in these patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 Contre-indications Mises warnings and precautions for use and 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
paediatric population : 
2 Métaboliseurs poor of CYP2C9 : 
patients poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspectés of be on the basis of génotype or history / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 , should receive the célécoxib with caution , as the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis has not been established . 
special precautions for may be necessary in these patients ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
Contre-indications 
- Maladie inflammatory intestine . 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis with the célécoxib has been studied up to 6 months and did not decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or another form of cancer or reduction of the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of the endoscopique monitoring replacement should not be decreased and surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis should not be delayed . 
gastrointestinal disorders Des high , gastrointestinal complications &#91; perforations , ulcers or haemorrhage ( PUH ) &#93; , some with fatal outcome have been observed in patients treated with célécoxib . 
there is potentiation of the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
3 Les patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis with anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after an in-depth evaluation pharmacodynamic Propriétés ( see section 5.1 ) . 
because of their lack of antiplatelet effects , reversible maois COX-2 cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases thromboembolic . 
therefore , agents platelet anti-agrégants should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics or with a risk of volume depletion . 
like all AINS , the célécoxib may lead to the development of a blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , blood pressure should be closely monitored at the beginning of treatment with célécoxib and throughout the course of treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , a attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the blood impaired , renal or hepatic function and particularly of cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical supervision should be established . 
renal and hepatic Affections Les AINS , including the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
the studies performed with the célécoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with the AINS comparators . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , a fonctionnelle impaired hepatic and the elderly . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic impairment mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 Posologie and method of administration pharmacokinetic Propriétés and 5.2 ) . 
4 Des appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration fonctionnelle of organs treatment mentioned during treatment . 
the risk of these effects appears to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in the majority of cases during the first month of treatment . 
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and Quincke oedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib undesirable Effets ( see section 4.8 ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued the first sign of skin rash , mucosal mucous membranes or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Les patients known to be poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin , haemorrhage serious were reported . 
caution should be taken in combination of célécoxib with warfarin or other anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules of Onsenal 200 mg contain lactose ( 49,8 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase due to LAPP or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction La majority interaction studies have been performed with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg bid ( as those used in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice daily do can therefore be excluded . 
anti-coagulante activity should be addressed in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly days after initiation or the change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , taking oral anticoagulants should with a narrow monitoring of prothrombin time INR patients . 
the AINS may reduce the effects of medicines diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , then as periodic . 
increased blood nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked during concomitant administration of AINS with the derivatives ciclosporin D or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored when combination of célécoxib with any of these medicines . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but can not be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention monitoring . 
pharmacodynamic Propriétés ( see section 5.1 ) . 
pharmacokinetic interactions 
effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products Le célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate of CYP2D6 , increased 136 . 
plasma concentrations of substrates medicines this enzyme may be increased in combination with the célécoxib . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2D6 are , e. g. antidepressants ( tricycliques and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of substrates of CYP2D6 including the dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if need at the start of treatment with the célécoxib or increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies have shown that the célécoxib was may inhibit the catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is unknown . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl ) . 
the célécoxib did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or glibenclamide as clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , the célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics ( plasma clearance or kidney ) methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of toxicity in methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
in healthy subjects , concomitant administration of 200 mg twice daily , célécoxib with 450 mg twice daily lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 of the Cmax and 18 of ASC lithium 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be closely monitored in introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
6 Chez subjects who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and who have increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due of exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by the CYP2C9 , it should be used to half of the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg célécoxib and 200 mg once daily , fluconazole , potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean Cmax 60 and the ASC of 130 of célécoxib . 
concomitant use with CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and 5.3 preclinical safety Données ) . 
the potential risk for the human is unknown . 
like other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , célécoxib may lead to an prématurée inertie utérine and closure of the during the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding pregnancy during treatment , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal plasma . 
administration of célécoxib to a limited number of breast-feeding women showed a very low blood whether célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
it has not been performed to determine studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
undesirable effects 
adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and classified by frequency in the Tableau 1 , on the basis of clinical sources follows : 
- Les adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as AINS not beta- groups of patients , approximately 7400 arthritiques have been treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
the side effects reported with the célécoxib in these studies have been cohérents with further in patients with rheumatoid arthritis of arthrose and Tableau 1 . 
- Les adverse reactions reported spontaneously after , period during 
which it is estimated to &gt; 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and indications ) . 
as all side effects are not reported in manufacturing AMM and enrolled in the pharmacovigilance data , it is difficult provide way reliable the frequency of these side effects .

PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : 
antinéoplasiques , atc ATC : 
the célécoxib is a derivative of pyrazole substitué by two groupements aryl analogue chemical other sulphonamides non-arylaminiques ( e. g. thiazides , furosémide ) but differently of sulphonamides arylaminiques ( e. g. sulfamethoxazole and other antibiotics sulphonamides ) . 
the célécoxib is a selective inhibitor lyophilisate , the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
no inhibition statistically significant COX-1 ( evaluated inhibition ex-vivo the formation of thromboxane B2 &#91; TxB2 &#93; ) has been observed in healthy volunteers to the clinical dose , familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) , of 400 mg twice daily . 
the cyclo-oxygénase is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins . 
two isoformes , COX-1 and COX-2 , have been identified . 
the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) is the isoform of the enzyme induced of a stimulus cytokines and is supposée be the major responsible for the synthesis of prostanoïdes mediators of pain , inflammation and fever . 
high levels of COX-2 is recovered in there lesions pré-malignes ( such as polyps adénomateux colorectaux ) and cancers épithéliaux . 
the familial adenomatous polyposis ( PAF ) is a disease net genetic genetic impaired autosomale dominante of a gene suppresseur of tumour , the gene APC ( Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ) . 
the polyps with of gene mutation APC and not treated surexprimant the COX-2 , continue of form and develop in the colon or rectum with a risk of progression to colorectal cancer 100 . 
the COX-2 is also involved in ovulation , implantation and closure of the , the régulation kidney function and some central nervous system functions ( fever induction , pain and your cognitive function ) . 
it may also thought to play a role in ulcer healing of . 
the COX-2 was apparent in the in tissue around gastric ulcers in man but its implication in healed of ulcers has not been established . 
the difference in antiplaquettaire activity between some AINS COX-1 and inhibitors reversible maois COX-2 may have a clinical significance in patients at risk of thromboembolic reactions . 
inhibitors prostacycline COX-2 reduce the formation of systemic ( and therefore possibly endothelial ) , without compromise the platelet thromboxane . 
dose-dependent effect on the formation of TxB2 was observed after high doses of célécoxib . 
however , in healthy subjects and in studies to low effectif , multiple-dose with 600 mg twice daily , the célécoxib had no effect on platelet aggregation , nor on the bleeding time compared to placebo . 
inhibition of the COX-2 may affect the viabilité of the tumour without relationship inflammation . 
the célécoxib inhibits the formation of tumours in the cancer preclinical models of the colon , which surexpriment the COX-2 , induites chimiquement ( the model rat AOM ) or by genetic mutation ( the model mouse MIN ) . 
it was shown to reduce the number and célécoxib the size of polyps adénomateux colorectaux . 
a study controlled , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , has been performed in 83 patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis . 
the study population consisted 58 patients undergoing previously a colectomie total or partial and 25 patients had a colon intact . 
thirteen subjects had a phenotype attenuated for the familial adenomatous polyposis . 
a reduction of the surface adenomatous duodénale were no marked has also been observed compared to placebo ( 14,5 with the célécoxib 400 mg twice daily versus 1.4 with placebo ) , which however was not statistically significant . 
results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of polyps in all treatment groups célécoxib compared to the groups correspondants treated with placebo . 
reducing the greater was observed in patients treated with the célécoxib at a dose of 16 mg / kg / day , which corresponds to the recommended dose of 800 mg daily in adults with PAF . 
safety data have been examined in Comité list by a surveillance indépendant , conclu that the dose of célécoxib of 16 mg / kg / day was a dose safely to recommend for futures studies in adolescents with PAF . 
long-term cardiovascular safety Etudes involving subjects with polyps adénomateux sporadiques : 
two studies in subjects with polyps adénomateux sporadiques have been conducted with the célécoxib , the trial APC ( prevention of adénome by the célécoxib ) and the trial PreSAP ( prevention of polyps adénomateux spontaneous ) . 
the trial APC has shown a dose-dependent increase of composite ( expertisé ) of death cardiovascular , myocardial infarction and AVC with the célécoxib compared to placebo during 3 years of treatment . 
the trial PreSAP did not show any statistically significant increase the risk to the same composite . 
the levels combined for this composite on 3 years were respectively 3.0 ( 20 cases / 671 subjects ) and 2.5 ( 17 cases / 685 subjects ) , against 0.9 ( 6 cases / 679 subjects ) for placebo . 
increases in both groups célécoxib and placebo if expliquent primarily by an increased incidence of myocardial infarction . 
in the clinical trial PreSAP the relative risk compared to placebo for this same composite ( expertisé ) was 1.2 ( IC 95 0.6 2.4 ) with a 400 mg daily célécoxib compared to placebo . 
the levels combined for this composite on 3 years were 2.3 ( 21 cases / 933 subjects ) and 1.9 ( 12 cases / 628 subjects ) . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction ( expertisé ) was 1.0 ( 9 subjects / 933 ) with a 400 mg daily célécoxib , against 0.6 ( 4 cases / 628 subjects ) with placebo . 
data from a third long-term called ADAPT ( The Alzheimer&apos; s Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial ) have not revealed no significant increase of cardiovascular risk associated with taking twice-daily 200 mg célécoxib compared to placebo . 
the relative risk compared to placebo for a composite similar ( deaths species CV , IDM , AVC ) was 1,14 ( IC 95 0.61 2.12 ) with a taking twice-daily 200 mg célécoxib . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction was 1.1 ( 8 cases / 717 patients ) with a taking twice-daily 200 mg célécoxib , against 1.2 ( 13 cases / 1070 patients ) with placebo . 
non-clinical data reveal no pooled tests randomised controlled trials suggest also that the cardiovascular risk may be associated with the use of célécoxib compared to placebo , indicating differences of the risk of the dose of célécoxib . 
12 Une marketing authorisation holder under exceptional circumstances was delivered to this medicine . 
this means that due to the rarity of this disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicine . 
the product Agence EMEA ) réévaluera each review any new information which may be provided , and if necessary this RCP will be shown to day . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the célécoxib is well absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations are attained in 2 to 3 hours approximately . 
the taken with food ( high fat meal ) delays the absorption of approximately 1 hour with an increase of absorption total ( ASC ) of 10 to 20 . 
the célécoxib is primarily eliminated by metabolism . 
less than 1 of the dose is eliminated unchanged in urine . 
variability inter-sujets of exposure to célécoxib is approximately 10-fold . 
at therapeutic doses , the pharmacokinetic profile célécoxib has a indépendant time and dose . 
the binding is approximately 97 at therapeutic concentrations , and the célécoxib is not préférentiellement bound to erythrocytes . 
the half-life of elimination is 8 to 12 hours . 
steady-state plasma concentrations are reached in less than 5 days of treatment . 
the pharmacological activity is attributed to the parent . 
main human metabolites present in the circulation did not activity décelable on the COX-1 or COX-2 . 
the metabolism of célécoxib is mainly bound to cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 . 
three metabolites inactive as monoamine COX-1 or COX-2 , have been identified in human plasma , a alcohol packaging the carboxylique corresponding and its conjugate form . 
the activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 is reduced in people with a polymorphisme genetic with for effect of reduce enzymatic activity , as with of variantes homozygous of polymorphisme CYP2C9 3 . 
in three studies were conducted in 5 of subjects distinctes génotype CYP2C9 3 / 3 , the AUC 0-24 of a single dose was increased 3x approximately metabolisers compared to normal . 
it is estimated to 0.3 to 1.0 the frequency of génotype 3 / 3 homozygote among different groups ethniques . 
patients poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspectés of be on the basis of history / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 , should receive the célécoxib with caution ( see section 4.2 ) . 
it has not been clinically significant differences differences in the pharmacokinetics of célécoxib between populations afro-américaine and caucasian . 
when a dose of 200 mg per day is given , corresponding in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41 and 146 . 
in patients with impaired mild to moderate , the metabolic capacity was well related to their levels albumin . 
in patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis with moderate hepatic impairment ( albumin between 25-35 g / l ) , the daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 . 
patients with severe hepatic impairment ( serum albumin &lt; 25g / l ) have not been studied , the célécoxib is contraindicated in this type of patients . 
13 La pharmacokinetics of célécoxib has not been studied in patients with renal impairment but should not be affected influence in these patients had concerns that it is extensively metabolised by the liver . 
there are limited data on the use of célécoxib in renal impairment and therefore , caution is recommended when treating patients with renal impairment . 
severe renal impairment is contraindication . 
preclinical safety data 
of hernies diaphragmatiques were also seen in a study of péri- toxicity and procedural natale in rats , which consisted of a exposure to product during the period of organogenèse . 
in this last study , the lowest approved exposure for which this impaired occurred in one animal relative margin safety was estimated 2 times the recommended daily dose in humans ( 800 mg ) . 
in animals , exposure to célécoxib during the early stages of embryonal caused of loss pre- and procedural implantatoires . 
these effects are expected following inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats . 
in a study of péri- and procedural natalité in rats , toxicity was observed in the offspring . 
in a study of toxicity two years , an increase of thrombosis not surrénaliennes was observed at high doses in male rats .

statement QUALITATIVE ET QUANTITATIVE 
each capsule contains 400 mg célécoxib . 
lactose Monohydraté 99.6 mg Pour excipients , see section 6.1 Liste of the excipients . 
PHARMACEUTIQUE form 
Gélules capsule white , opaque with two bandes has indicating 7767 and 400 . 
CLINIQUES data 
therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( PAF ) , in combination with the surgery and in addition to standard endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of reducing the number and size of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is one capsule of 400 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 Propriétés Contre-indications pharmacokinetic ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in these patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 Contre-indications Mises warnings and precautions for use and 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
paediatric population : 
16 Métaboliseurs poor of CYP2C9 : 
patients poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 or suspectés of be on the basis of génotype or history / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 , should receive the célécoxib with caution , as the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis has not been established . 
special precautions for may be necessary in these patients ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
Contre-indications 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis with the célécoxib has been studied up to 6 months and did not decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or another form of cancer or reduction of the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the management usual patients with familial adenomatous polyposis should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of the endoscopique monitoring replacement should not be decreased and surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis should not be delayed . 
there is potentiation of the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
significant differences in the safety gastrointestinal between the combination reversible maois COX-2 / acetylsalicylic acid and combination AINS / acetylsalicylic acid has not been demonstrated in clinical trials long-term ( see section 5.1 ) . 
17 L&apos; combination of célécoxib and AINS other than aspirin should be avoided . 
patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis with anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive concomitant therapy including anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after an in-depth evaluation pharmacodynamic Propriétés ( see section 5.1 ) . 
due to their absence of effects platelet , reversible maois COX-2 cannot be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases thromboembolic . 
therefore , agents platelet anti-agrégant should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema have been observed in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics or with a risk of volume depletion . 
like all AINS , the célécoxib may lead to the development of a blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , blood pressure should be closely monitored at the beginning of treatment with célécoxib and throughout the course of treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , a attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the blood impaired , renal or hepatic function and particularly of cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical supervision should be established . 
renal and hepatic Affections Les AINS , including the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
the studies performed with the célécoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with the AINS comparators . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , a fonctionnelle impaired hepatic and the elderly . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
18 L&apos; experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic impairment mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
of appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration fonctionnelle a of organs treatment mentioned during treatment . 
skin reactions Des serious skin reactions , some fatal outcome , as the dermatitis exfoliative , the Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( Lyell ) , have been reported very rarely in combination with the use of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the risk of these effects appears to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in the majority of cases during the first month of treatment . 
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and Quincke oedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued the first sign of skin rash , mucosal mucous membranes or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Les patients known to be poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 pharmacokinetic Propriétés ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin haemorrhage serious were reported . 
caution should be exercised when concomitant administration of célécoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules of Onsenal 400 mg contain lactose ( 99,6 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase due to LAPP or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction La majority interaction studies have been performed with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg bid ( as those used in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice daily do can therefore be excluded . 
anti-coagulante activity should be addressed in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , particularly days after initiation or the change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , taking oral anticoagulants should with a narrow monitoring of prothrombin time INR patients . 
19 Les AINS may reduce the effects of medicines diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , then as periodic . 
increased blood nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked during concomitant administration of AINS with the derivatives ciclosporin D or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored when combination of célécoxib with any of these medicines . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but can not be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention monitoring . 
pharmacodynamic Propriétés ( see section 5.1 ) . 
pharmacokinetic interactions 
effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products Le célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate of CYP2D6 , increased 136 . 
plasma concentrations of substrates medicines this enzyme may be increased in combination with the célécoxib . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2D6 are , e. g. antidepressants ( tricycliques and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of substrates of CYP2D6 including the dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if need at the start of treatment with the célécoxib or increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies have shown that the célécoxib was may inhibit the catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is unknown . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl ) . 
the célécoxib did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or glibenclamide as clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , the célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics ( plasma clearance or kidney ) methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of toxicity in methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
20 Chez healthy subjects , concomitant administration of 200 mg twice daily , célécoxib with 450 mg twice daily lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 of the Cmax and 18 of ASC lithium 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be closely monitored in introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
in subjects who are poor metabolisers of CYP2C9 and who have increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due of exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by the CYP2C9 , it should be used to half of the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg célécoxib and 200 mg once daily , fluconazole , potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean Cmax 60 and the ASC of 130 of célécoxib . 
concomitant use with CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction ( see sections 4.3 Contre-indications and 5.3 preclinical safety Données ) . 
the potential risk for the human is unknown . 
like other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , célécoxib may lead to an prématurée inertie utérine and closure of the during the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding pregnancy during treatment , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal plasma . 
administration of célécoxib to a limited number of breast-feeding women showed a very low blood whether célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
it has not been performed to determine studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and classified by frequency in the Tableau 1 , on the basis of clinical sources follows : 
- Les adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as AINS not beta- groups of patients , approximately 7400 arthritiques have been treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
- Les adverse reactions reported spontaneously after , period during 
which it is estimated to &gt; 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and indications ) . 
as all side effects are not reported in manufacturing AMM and enrolled in the pharmacovigilance data , it is difficult provide way reliable the frequency of these side effects .
