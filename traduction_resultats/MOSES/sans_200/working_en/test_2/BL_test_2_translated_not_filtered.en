hypersensitivity to the active substance , to arachides or soya or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average dose 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
however , the clinical experience 
49 the olanzapine is limited in patients with disease associated , caution is recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
50 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take the tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
51 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
57 Chez patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
58 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
59 Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age over 65 years of age , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , disease 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
64 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
65 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take the tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
66 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
72 Chez patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
73 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
74 Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
mutagenicity 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average dose 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
however , the clinical experience 
79 the olanzapine is limited in patients with disease associated , caution is recommended when its medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
80 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE MYLAN tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
the film-coating contains soya lecithin . 
patients allergic to arachides or soya should not take the tablets . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
81 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
85 Au within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as : 
very common ( 1 / 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other bêta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
88 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
89 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who had responded to treatment with the olanzapine in mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients with a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine can be 
2 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age over 65 years of age , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or a combination of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
4 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors ( vte ) , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
5 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
6 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

10 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration .

overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
14 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents .

acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity L&apos; olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
mutagenicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity D&apos; after the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who had responded to treatment with the olanzapine in mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients with a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine can be 
18 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age over 65 years of age , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or a combination of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
20 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors ( vte ) , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
21 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
22 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

26 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
30 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience .

therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness clinical improvement in the long term . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who had responded to treatment with the olanzapine in mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients with a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine can be 
34 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age over 65 years of age , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or a combination of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
36 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors ( vte ) , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
37 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
38 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

42 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
46 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness clinical improvement in the long term . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who had responded to treatment with the olanzapine in mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients with a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase of doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at least 24 hours intervals . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
51 Des events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
52 Fonction Des transient and asymptomatic elevations of liver transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors ( vte ) , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
53 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
54 Effets potential of olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
58 Une clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness . 
frequency categories are defined as :

increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
59 Traitement of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
61 L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 62 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity L&apos; olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
mutagenicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity D&apos; after the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

DONNEES CLINIQUES 
therapeutic indications 
adults L&apos; olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia . 
in patients initially responding to treatment , the olanzapine has shown its effectiveness clinical improvement in the long term . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes . 
the olanzapine is indicated for the prevention recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , who had responded to treatment with the olanzapine in mania ( see section 5.1 ) . 
posology and method of administration 
adults Schizophrénie : 
the recommended starting dose of the olanzapine is 10 mg per day . 
Episode mania : the initial dose is 15 mg once a day as monotherapy or 10 mg daily in combination ( see section 5.1 ) . 
recurrence prevention in disorder : 
the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients with a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
the olanzapine can be 
65 administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
in this patient population , an age over 65 years of age , dysphagia , sedation , malnutrition and dehydration , pulmonary ( such as a radiation with or without inhalation ) or a combination of 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
67 recommended during the medical in patients with symptoms of hypertrophy prostatique , ileus paralytic or any other condition with the system cholinergique . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors ( vte ) , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
rare cases of 
68 convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Les OLANZAPINE NEOPHARMA tablets contain lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
69 Avec fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

73 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration .

increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
signs and symptoms En case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
treatment of overdose Il no specific antidote for overdose of . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
do not use the adrenaline , dopamine , or other beta-sympathomimétique as stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in adolescents 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
77 between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
acute toxicity ( single dose ) Les signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity Dans studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
reproductive toxicity L&apos; olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
mutagenicity L&apos; olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
carcinogenicity D&apos; after the results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
3 Des events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
4 Fonction Des transient and asymptomatic elevations of liver transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
5 Dyskinésie dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
6 Effets potential of olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
12 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
13 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 L / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
14 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 L / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
15 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
18 Enfants and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose .

during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
19 Des events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipidiquesDes administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
20 symptoms associated with hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant use of the olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
21 Hypotension postural Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance .

cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
29 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
30 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
31 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase of doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at least 24 hours intervals . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose .

patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
35 Des events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
anticholinergiqueBien activity than the olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
36 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms associated with hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
37 postural Hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
44 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
45 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
46 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
47 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
51 Des events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants .

in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic autraitement . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
52 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms associated with hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
53 postural Hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interactions consideration is expected as it could be 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
60 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
in a study in patients receiving lithium or valproate for at least two weeks , the introduction of 10 mg of olanzapine ( 
61 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
62 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
63 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase of doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at least 24 hours intervals . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose .

patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
67 Des events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants .

the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
68 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms associated with hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
69 Hypotension postural Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interactions consideration is expected as it could be 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults . 
the following table summary of the side effects reported with a greater frequency patients in adolescents ( aged 13 to 17 years ) than in adult or adverse reactions only observed in clinical trials of short duration performed in patients adolescents . 
clinically significant weight gain ( 7 ) surviendrait more commonly in adolescents compared with of adult patients with an exposure similar . 
the magnitude of the weight gain and the proportion of patients adolescents who have had an increase in weight clinically significant were higher in a prolonged exposure ( at least 24 weeks ) than in exposure of short duration . 
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
76 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
77 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
78 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
79 prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase of doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at least 24 hours intervals . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) . 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
83 Des events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
caution should be exercised in patients 
84 with an increase of ALAT and / or ASAT , in patients with signs and symptoms associated with hepatic injury , in patients with hepatic impairment pré-traitement and in patients treated with other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
85 Hypotension postural Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
lactose Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets , contains lactose . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency of Lapp or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
therefore , no interactions consideration is expected as it could be 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in terms of proportion of patients in remission manic symptoms and suicidal ideation to 6 to 12 weeks . 
93 combination with lithium or valproate ) , produced after 6 weeks , with a reduction manic symptoms greater than that observed in patients receiving lithium or valproate monotherapy . 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
the cyp P450-CYP1A2 and P450-CYP2D6 &apos;s the formation of the metabolite N-desmethyl and metabolite 2-hydroxymethyl . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
in healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
94 Chez women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
toxicity 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
ci prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

the dose and frequency of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets .

Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant , has been 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
administration lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
101 emboliques venous , any degree of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , oral solution contains the tartrazine indigo ( E102 ) , which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
102 data are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
103 Dans a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
orodispersible tablet olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
film-coated tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
110 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

the recommended starting dose is 10 mg / day . 
in patients with a mania for the prophylaxis recurrence , therapy should be maintained at the same dose . 
in the expression clinical episode , the symptoms thymique should be taken together . 
in all indications , the daily dose of olanzapine may be adjusted depending on the patient &apos;s clinical status between 5 and 20 mg per day . 
an increase of doses higher than the recommended starting dose is recommended that following an appropriate clinical reassessment and should not generally be considered at least 24 hours intervals . 
the olanzapine may be administered with or without food , food has no incidence on the absorption . 
it should be gradual discontinuation by dose tapering when discontinuation of . 
orodispersible tablet Olanzapine Teva should be placed in the mouth where it will rapidly dissolved in saliva , and therefore easily swallowed . 
it is difficult to the intact orodispersible tablet . 
the oral solution is fragile , it should be administered immediately after opening the blister . 
it may also be dissolved in a large glass of water or any other drinks adjusted ( orange juice , milk , juice pomme or chew ) immediately before administration . 
orodispersible tablet olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
the dose and frequency of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors ruvrique warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution . 
gender La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustment in women compared to humans . 
smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 )

hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
116 Anomalies lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
117 Activité general on the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
in clinical studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies related to treatment was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
118 L&apos; mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
124 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
orodispersible tablet olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
film-coated tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
126 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

the dose and frequency of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors ruvrique warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients . 
in cases of moderate cirrhosis , Child-Pugh class A or B ) , the initial dose should be of 5 mg and will be increased with caution .

special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
132 Anomalies lipid Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
133 Activité general on the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies related to treatment was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
yellow orangé S ( E110 ) : 
olanzapine Teva , oral solution contains the yellow orangé S ( E110 ) , which may cause allergic reactions . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
134 Inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
the mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
the olanzapine also demonstrated clinical efficacy results comparable haloperidol in the proportion of patients in remission of 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
orodispersible tablet olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
film-coated tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
i.e. Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

the dose and frequency of this form are similar to those of tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine orodispersible tablet can be used as an alternative to form tablet enrobé . 
children and adolescents L&apos; using the olanzapine in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy . 
weight gain , abnormalities lipid and levels of prolactine have been reported in a magnitude higher in the short term studies in patients adolescents compared with studies in adult patients ( see sections 4.4 , 4.8 , 5.1 and 5.2 ) . 
elderly patients Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) is not indicated systematically but should may be considered in patients aged 65 years of age and older when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) . 
patients with renal impairment and / or liver Une lower starting dose ( 5 mg per day ) should be considered for these patients .

smoking La initial dose and the dose range do not require adjustments in patients not smoking compared to smoking . 
the addition of a blood factor can slow down the metabolism ( female , elderly , not fumeur ) may be used to support a reduction of the initial dose . 
when it is indicated , the increase in dose should be given with caution in these patients . 
if upward titration of 2.5 mg is necessary , it should be used Olanzapine Teva , film-coated tablets . 
( see sections 4.5 and 5.2 ) 
Contre-indications 
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients . 
patients with a risk known glaucoma narrow- angle glaucoma . 
special warnings and precautions for use 
during antipsychotic treatment , the improvement of the patient may take several days , even several weeks . 
patients should be monitored closely during this period . 
a higher incidence of death has not been associated with the dose of olanzapine ( average daily dose of 4,4 mg ) or the duration of treatment . 
however , regardless of these risk factors , the incidence of mortality was higher in the olanzapine ( compared with placebo ) . 
adverse events accidents ( such as myocardial infarction , transient ischaemic attack ) , some with fatal outcome , have been reported in the same clinical trials . 
three times greater events accidents have been reported in the group of patients treated with olanzapine compared to the group of patients treated with placebo ( 1.3 ) versus 0.4 , respectively ) . 
all patients treated with olanzapine or placebo who have experienced an event accident , had risk factors préexistants . 
a greater than 75 years of age and a type of dementia vascular or mixed have been identified as risk factors for adverse events accidents in the group . 
the efficacy of olanzapine has not been demonstrated in these trials . 
Parkinson disease L&apos; administration of olanzapine to patients parkinsoniens with illnesses drug ( agonists , ) is not recommended . 
in these studies , patients had to be been stabilised at the start of study the minimal effective dose of therapy anti-parkinsonien ( a hypoactivity ) and to the same treatment antiparkinsonien , at the same strength , throughout the study . 
the starting dose of the olanzapine was 2.5 mg / day and could be adjusted by the investigator up to a maximum of 15 mg / day . 
syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) Le Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) is a potentially fatal symptom complex in combination with antipsychotic therapy . 
in rare cases , reported as Syndrome Malin of Neuroleptiques ( SMN ) have also been notifiés under . 
clinical signs of SMN 36 , altered mental status , and signs of instability neuro-végétative ( irregular pulse and blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and heart rate ) . 
may include signs such as elevated CPK , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure . 
if a patient develops signs or symptoms indicative SMN , or hyperthermia unexplained other signs of SMN , all antipsychotic including olanzapine should be discontinued . 
diabetes mellitus , hyperglycaemia and De rare cases of hyperglycaemia and / or of new-onset or exacerbation of diabetes , sometimes associated with ketoacidosis or coma , in some cases , have been reported ( see section 4.8 ) . 
in some cases , weight gain in the past , which may be a degree prédisposant has been reported . 
adequate clinical monitoring is recommended , especially in diabetic patients and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of diabetes whom periodic monitoring of glycaemic control is recommended . 
two other lipid Anomalies Des administration lipid have been observed in patients treated with the olanzapine during clinical trials versus placebo ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the changes lipid should be managed as clinically appropriate evaluated , particularly in patients with rare lipid and in patients with risk factors that may bruise the development of general lipid . 
activity anticholinergique Bien as olanzapine has been shown that anticholinergique activity in vitro , the incidence of related to this activity has been approved in clinical trials . 
transient liver function Des and asymptomatic elevations of transaminases ( ALAT ASAT ) and were frequently reported especially at the start of treatment . 
the occurrence of elevations of ALAT and / or ASAT during treatment should be observed follow-up , and possibly a dose reduction . 
in cases where hepatitis has been diagnosed ( including hepatic injury cytolytiques , cholestatiques or mixed ) , treatment with olanzapine should be discontinued . 
neutropenia has been commonly reported during concomitant administration of olanzapine and valproate ( see section 4.8 ) . 
discontinuation of treatment Des acute symptoms such as sweating , insomnia , tremor , anxiousness , nausea or vomiting have been reported very rarely ( &lt; 0.01 ) sudden withdrawal of treatment . 
thromboembolic injury Des reached thromboembolic ( have been very rarely reported with the olanzapine ( &lt; 0.01 ) . 
it has not been established of causal relationship between the occurrence of these reached and the treatment with . 
however , patients with schizophrenia with often risk factors for venous thromboembolic emboliques , factor of the potential risk of thromboembolic ( ( immobilisation such the capsules ) should be identified and measures préventives special instituted . 
149 Activité general on the Système Nerveux Central Compte-tenu of the main measure of effectiveness olanzapine on the Système Nerveux Central , it will be taken in combination with centrally acting medicinal products and alcohol . 
due to its 1-adrenergic of dopamine in vitro , olanzapine may antagoniser the effects of agonists direct or indirect harmful effects of dopamine . 
seizures L&apos; olanzapine should be used with caution in patients who have a history of convulsions or who are treated in of conditions that may lower the level convulsif . 
rare cases of convulsions have been reported in patients treated with . 
in most of these cases , there were corresponding to a history of convulsions or risk factors seizures . 
dyskinesia dyskinesia Dans studies comparatives duration equal to or less than 1 year , the occurrence of dyskinésies related to treatment was significantly lower in the group . 
however , the risk of any tardive dyskinesia up with the duration of exposure , the dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment should be considered at the signs of tardive dyskinesia . 
these symptoms may temporally deteriorate or even occur following discontinuation of treatment . 
postural hypotension Une orthostatic hypotension were rarely observed in the elderly , in clinical trials . 
as with other antipsychotics , it is recommended to measure periodically the pressure in patients over 65 years of age . 
use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents . 
the studies performed in patients aged 13 to 17 years of age have shown various adverse events , including weight gain , changes in behaviour and elevations metabolic blood levels of prolactine . 
the long-term effects associated with these events have not been studied and remain unknown ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . 
the tablets are friables and they should not be poussés out of the blister . 
the foil recouvrant the bottle should be removed to remove the tablet . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
interaction studies have only been performed in adults . 
potential interactions with an effect on the olanzapine L&apos; olanzapine is metabolised by cytochrome CYP1A2 , atypical stimulate or inhibit specifically this isoenzyme may affect the pharmacokinetics of . 
induction of CYP1A2 Le metabolism of olanzapine may be stimulé by smoking and carbamazepine , which may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of . 
only a increase mild to moderate of the clearance of olanzapine has been observed . 
it is likely that the clinical implications are available , but clinical monitoring is recommended , and an increase in dosage of olanzapine may be considered if needed ( see section 4.2 ) . 
inhibition of CYP1A2 Il has been shown that fluvoxamine , specific inhibitor of CYP1A2 , inhibits the metabolism of . 
fluvoxamine results in a mean of Cmax of olanzapine 54 in women non-fumeuses and 77 in men smoking . 
150 L&apos; mean increase of ASC of olanzapine was by 52 and 108 . 
a starting dose lower of olanzapine should be considered in patients treated with fluvoxamine , or any other inhibitor of CYP1A2 e. g. ciprofloxacin . 
dose reduction of the olanzapine should be considered if treatment with an inhibitor of CYP1A2 is initiated . 
decreased bioavailability Le charcoal reduces the bioavailability of olanzapine orally 50-60 and should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of . 
with the fluoxetine ( inhibitor of CYP2D6 ) , single doses of antacids ( aluminium ) , magnesium or cimetidine , there was no evidence of significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of . 
the potential effects of the olanzapine on other medicinal products L&apos; olanzapine may antagoniser direct or indirect harmful effects on the effects of agonists , . 
the olanzapine does not inhibit isoenzymes of CYP450 in vitro ( i. e. 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 ) . 
no interaction was observed in the concomitant use of the olanzapine and lithium or bipéridène . 
monitoring of plasma levels of valproate did not show the need to adjust the dose of valproate after the start of treatment . 
general activity the Système Nerveux Central La caution is recommended in patients who consomment alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products dépresseurs central nervous system . 
concomitant use of the olanzapine and medicinal products anti-parkinsonien in patients with parkinson &apos;s disease and dementia is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . 
range QTc La caution should be exercised if the olanzapine is given concomitantly with medicinal products known to prolong the QTc ( see section 4.4 ) . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no adequate and well-controlled conducted in pregnant women . 
patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment . 
however , in women is limited experience , the olanzapine should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus . 
very rare cases of tremblement , hypertonia , lethargy , drowsiness have been spontaneously reported in neonates of mothers treated with the olanzapine during the third trimester of pregnancy . 
in a study of patients women allaitant , olanzapine has been detected in breast milk . 
the average exposure of neonates at steady state ( in mg / kg ) was estimated to be approximately 1.8 of the dose of olanzapine reçue by mother ( in mg / kg ) . 
therefore , breast-feeding is not recommended for patients with . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
due to the risk of drowsiness and headache dizziness , patients should be advised on the risk associated with the use of machines , including the driving to moteur .

in a clinical trial conducted in patients with a mania in bipolar disorder , during concomitant use of valproate the frequency of neutropenia has been 4.1 ; one factor contributif potential may be plasma levels of valproate . 
a greater than 10 of the case of tremor , dry mouth , increased appetite , and weight gain was observed in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate . 
of speech have also been reported . 
in the combination of olanzapine lithium or valproate increased equal or greater than 7 of the baseline body weight occurred in 17,4 of patients during the acute phase of treatment ( up to 6 weeks ) . 
in the long term treatment with the olanzapine ( up to 12 months ) in preventing recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder , an increase in weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight has been reported in 39,9 of patients . 
children and adolescents L&apos; olanzapine is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years of age . 
although no clinical study comparing the adolescents to adults has been given , data from clinical studies in adolescents was compared to those from clinical trials in adults .

9 Une increased weight equal or greater than 7 compared with baseline body weight ( kg ) was very common in 43.5 adolescent patients and an increase in weight equal or greater than 15 compared with baseline body weight was frequently . 
among patients adolescents , the mean weight gain was higher in patients who were overweight or obese to the initiation of treatment . 
changes in total cholesterol fasting with a normal at the start of therapy ( &lt; 4.39 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) were frequently . 
changes in total cholesterol fasting with a baseline limit at the start of therapy ( 4.39- &lt; 5.17 mmol / l ) devenant ( 5.17 mmol / l ) have been very common . 
increased prolactinémie reported in 47,4 adolescent patients . 
overdose 
in case of overdose , the symptoms very commonly reported ( incidence &gt; 10 ) are : tachycardia , aggression , agitation / dysarthrie , eps various and a decrease in the level of consciousness from the sedation at coma . 
other effects clinically significant of overdose are : delusion , convulsions , coma , possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome , respiratory failure , fausse start , hypertension or hypotension , cardiac ( less than 2 of the case of overdose ) and discontinue cardio-respiratoire . 
of évolutions have been reported in clinical experience to a dose as low as 450 mg but a course was benign has also been reported following overdose with 1500 mg . 
there is no specific antidote . 
it is not recommended to cause vomiting . 
the standard management of overdose may be used ( gastric lavage , administration of activated charcoal ) . 
concomitant administration of activated charcoal reduces the oral bioavailability of olanzapine 50-60 . 
symptomatic treatment and monitoring of should be based on the condition , including treatment of hypotension and shock circulation and a respiratory assistance . 
- 156 stimulation beta adrenergic receptor may exacerbate the hypotension . 
cardiac monitoring is required to detect possible arrhythmias . 
close medical supervision and cardiac should be continued for up to the patient recovers . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics : diazépines , oxazépines and thiazépines , ATC atc N05A H03 . 
the olanzapine is a antipsychotic agent , antimaniaque and thymorégulateur with a wide pharmacological profile on a number of receptors . 
studies in behaviour in animals have shown a antagonisme systems 5HT , dopaminergic , cholinergic and support the safety profile of attaching to receptors . 
it has been demonstrated in vitro studies that olanzapine had a higher affinity for the receptors serotonin 5HT2 for dopamine D2 , and a greater models in vivo the 5HT2 compared to models D2 . 
it has been demonstrated in clinical studies électrophysiologiques as olanzapine reduced selective transmission to neurones dopaminergic system modulates ( A10 ) , while the effect observed system striatal ( A9 ) involved in motor activity is limited . 
the olanzapine reduces the response of the test évitement packed , which may indicate a antipsychotic activity , at doses lower than those treatments induction of catalepsie , effect which may indicate the development of the side effects motor . 
in contrast to other agents antipsychotics , olanzapine increases the response to test for &quot; anxiolyse &quot; . 
in a study of tomographie by back of positron ( PET ) in healthy volunteers and a single oral dose ( 10 mg ) , the olanzapine resulted in a receptor occupancy 5HT2A greater than that of receptors D2 . 
in patients with a mania or mixed in the setting of bipolar disorder , olanzapine showed an effectiveness greater than that of placebo and valproate phosphate on reduction manic symptoms on 3 weeks . 
in a study in patients treated with the 
a significant difference in favour of olanzapine compared to placebo was seen in the primary endpoint of the recurs in the bipolar disorder . 
the olanzapine was used at a dose flexible démarrant to 2.5 mg and up to 20 mg per day . 
during treatment with the olanzapine , adolescents have taken more weight statistically significant compared to adults . 
the magnitude of changes in serum fasting total cholesterol , triglycerides , cholesterol LDL and prolactine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) was higher in children as in adults . 
there are no data on the treatment of sustained and data on safety in the long term are limited ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
orodispersible tablet olanzapine is to be bioequivalent to tablets enrobés of olanzapine , with a similar rate and extent of absorption . 
film-coated tablet of olanzapine may be used as an alternative to tablets enrobés . 
the olanzapine is well absorbed after oral administration , the maximum plasma concentrations are attained within 5 to 8 hours . 
absorption is not influenced by the presence of food . 
the absolute oral bioavailability compared to intravenous administration has not been determined . 
the olanzapine is metabolised in the liver via conjugation and oxidation . 
the main circulating metabolite is the 10-N-glucuronide , do not pass the haematoencephalic barrier . 
these two metabolites have shown a pharmacological activity in vivo significantly lower than the olanzapine in animal studies . 
the primary pharmacological activity is due to the parent , . 
after oral administration , the mean half-life of elimination terminal of olanzapine in healthy subjects ranged in age or gender . 
158 Chez healthy subjects elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) compared to young healthy volunteers , the mean elimination half-lives of olanzapine is prolonged ( 51,8 versus 33,8 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 17.5 vs. 18,2 l / hour ) . 
variability pharmacokinetics in the elderly is comparable to that seen in the blood vessels young . 
44 schizophrenia and in patients over 65 years of age , doses of 5 to 20 mg per day have not been associated with a profile of the side effects . 
in women compared to humans , the mean elimination half-life is prolonged slightly ( 36,7 vs. 32,3 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.9 vs. 27.3 l / hour ) . 
however , the olanzapine ( 5 - 20 mg ) was a similar safety profile in women ( n = 467 ) and in men ( n = 869 ) . 
however , liver function test of mass studies have shown that approximately 57 of a dose of olanzapine branded by a isotope radioactif was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites . 
in patients not smoking , compared to smoking ( men and women ) , the elimination half-life is prolonged ( 38,6 vs. 30.4 hours ) and a reduced clearance ( 18.6 vs. were 27.7 l / hour ) . 
plasma clearance of olanzapine is lower in the elderly than in those of young subjects , in women than in men , and in patients not smoking that smokers . 
however , the impact of age , gender , smoking , on clearance and the half-life of olanzapine is low compared to the overall variability interpatient . 
a study including caucasian , japanese and chinois , there was no difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters between three populations . 
the rate of attach the olanzapine on the plasma proteins is approximately 93 , for a range of concentration ranging from approximately 7 to 1000 ng / ml . 
the olanzapine binds mainly to albumin and to the 1-glycoprotéine acid . 
paediatric population Adolescents ( from 13 to 17 years ) : the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine were similar between adolescents and adults . 
in clinical studies , the mean exposure to olanzapine was approximately higher 27 in adolescents . 
the differences démographiques between adolescents , adults applies to a mean weight below and a reduced number less of smoking in adolescents . 
these factors may contribute to the observation of the mean exposure higher in adolescents . 
preclinical safety data 
signs of toxicity after oral administration in rodents are characteristics neuroleptics potent : dopaminergic , coma , tremor , seizure cloniques , hypersalivation , and a decrease in body weight . 
the doses medians lethal were approximately 210 mg / kg ( ) and 175 mg / kg ( rats ) . 
dogs were tolerated single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg without décéder . 
the clinical symptoms were observed as follows : sedation , ataxia , tremor , and increased of heart rate , respiratory difficult , myosis and anorexia . 
in monkeys , single oral doses up to 100 mg / kg have an prostration , and at high doses , a condition of semi-inconscience . 
in clinical studies of up to 3 months in mice and up to 1 year in rats and dogs , the effects important were depression of SNC , anticholinergiques and in peripheral blood . 
a safety appeared to depression of SNC . 
the pharmacokinetics of growth have been reduced at high doses . 
the effects reversible associated with the rise in the prolactinémie in pregnant rats included a reduction of body weight of cancers and utérus , changes in vaginal epithelium morphologiques and glande mammaire . 
haematological toxicity : 
of haematological effects have been observed in each of the species , including reductions dose-dépendantes the number of white blood cells , in mice and a decrease non-specific leukocytes , in rats ; however , no evidence of cytotoxicité marrow has been shown . 
in dogs cytopéniques , no adverse effects on the stem cells or dose-related proliferative of the bone marrow have been observed . 
the olanzapine did not show any teratogenic effect . 
the sedation had an effect on the ability of impair mating in male rats . 
in the label of rats who received the olanzapine , a retardation of foetal development , and a transient decrease in rate of offspring was observed . 
the olanzapine showed no mutagenic or clastogenic , in a standard battery of tests complete , such as mutation bacterial tests and an in vitro and in vivo mammalian . 
based on results of studies in mice and rats , it has been conclu as olanzapine was not carcinogenic .

infants , children and adolescents 
- Retard of growth consistent with a deficiency somatotrope 
- Retard of growth related to a syndrome of Turner 
- Retard of growth associated with chronic renal failure . 
- Retard of growth ( height current &lt; -2,5 score SDS ( standard deviation ) and size parentale 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by the genetic measures . 
adults 
- Traitement replacement therapy in adult patients with severe somatotrope . 
patients 
with somatotrope severe iatrogenic immunosuppression in adulthood are defined as who have a condition known hypothalamo-hypophysaire and at least one other hormone deficiency hypophysaire , except that of the prolactine . 
a single test dynamic should be performed to diagnostiquer or exclure deficiency growth hormone in these patients . 
the limits dynamiques testing should be swallowed defined . 
posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
posology and method of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were observed . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
children with the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year , including the épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
growth retardation in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure patients : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses may be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 DS .

deficiency , growth hormone in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually over the needs of the patient , determined by the rate of IGF-1 in order to ensure concentrations IGF-1 , on the basis of age , above the upper limit of 2 DS . 
patients with the rise in IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should be given for the growth hormone up to a level of IGF-1 within sufficiently in excess of the normal range , not to exceed 2 DS . 
the clinical response in the same as undesirable effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increase of the sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate with oestrogen , are sous-dosées while males are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the hormone somatotrope should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , a reduction of dose as soon as possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
3 L&apos; injection should be subcutaneous use and the injection site should vary for the onset of lipoatrophies . 
instructions for use and handling , see section 6.6 .

in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been established in the following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , it may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration of T4 and an increase in the serum concentration of T3 . 
in general , the levels peripheral of hormones are in current to healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on the rate of hormones may have a clinical consequences for patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique central in which a theoretically hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is especially advised control thyroid function by initiation of therapy with the somatropine and following dose adjustment . 
a decrease in the levels of serum cortisol has been reported with the somatropine ; this may be related to changes in transport proteins or to an increase in hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of severe somatotrope secondary to antitumour treatment , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with endocrine disorders , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequent in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe headache or repeated , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of oeil to dépister for swelling papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if appropriate , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
4 recommend the course of continued therapy , the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
however , the clinical experience showed that the réintroduction of treatment was often possible without récurrence intracranial of hypertension . 
if treatment with the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of the symptoms of an increase in blood pressure intracranial is required . 
in patients aged over 60 years of age , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be combined with energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting treatment with the somatropine in patients with a syndrome of Prader- Willi , for signs of occlusion airway , sleep disorder apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of occlusion airway , problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the hormone .

a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop when growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of the scoliose during treatment with the hormone . 
the experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before starting treatment , then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a hyperglycaemia cause by mouth should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical event , growth hormone should not be given . 
5 Chez children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to measure the levels of IGF-l prior to initiating therapy , and subsequently 2 times a year . 
if on measures repeated , the levels of IGF-l &apos;s benefits are greater than 2 DS compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
the experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately prior to the onset of puberty in children neonates are small for gestational age is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy just before the onset of puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final solution should be reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal prior to initiating therapy . 
to be confirmed delayed , the growth and it is in the past should be followed during 1 year before start of treatment . 
during this period , the treatment of chronic renal failure ( including control of the acidosis , hyperparathyroïdie and steady nutritionnel ) should have been observed and should be maintained during the course of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued in the event of kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent of patients with chronic renal failure patients treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
Etant due to the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients experiencing acute critique , the benefits of continuing treatment in this situation balance should be shown with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a critique acute other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine balance should be shown with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of a drug interaction study performed in adults who have a deficiency , growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome p450 isoenzymes P450 . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical relevance of this effect is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and in section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogen . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there is no clinical experience of therapy in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animal studies on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in the event of pregnancy . 
in a pregnancy normal , the levels of growth hormone hypophysaire decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the hormone 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary in patients of low in growth hormone in women for the q3 of pregnancy . 
it is not known as the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the intestinal absorption gastrointestinal protein in the child is very unlikely . 
particular attention should be paid when Omnitrope is administered to women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
a reduction of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is started , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects associated with fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these effects are uncommon severe to moderate , they may occur in the first month of treatment and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these events is related to the administered dose and the age of patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in paediatric patients , these side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leucémies have been reported in paediatric patients atteintsd&apos; deficiency growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency is similar to those in patients with no deficiency growth hormone .

- Retard of growth related to a syndrome of Turner . 
- Retard of growth associated with chronic renal failure . 
- Retard of growth ( height current &lt; - &lt; -2,5 score SDS ( standard deviation ) and size 
the diagnosis of SPW should be confirmed by the genetic measures . 
adults 
- Traitement replacement therapy in adult patients with severe somatotrope . 
patients 
with somatotrope severe iatrogenic immunosuppression in adulthood are defined as who have a condition known hypothalamo-hypophysaire and at least one other hormone deficiency hypophysaire , except the prolactine . 
a single test dynamic should be performed to diagnostiquer or exclure deficiency growth hormone in these patients . 
the limits dynamiques testing should be swallowed defined . 
posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
posology and method of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were observed . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
paediatric patients with the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year , including the épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
growth retardation in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure patients : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses can be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 DS .

deficiency , growth hormone in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually over the needs of the patient , determined by the rate of IGF-1 in order to ensure concentrations IGF-1 , on the basis of age , above the upper limit of 2 DS . 
patients with the rise in IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should be given for the growth hormone up to a level of IGF-1 within sufficiently in excess of the normal range , not to exceed 2 DS . 
the clinical response in the same as undesirable effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increase of the sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate with oestrogen , are sous-dosées while males are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the hormone somatotrope should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , a reduction of dose as soon as possible . 
the minimal effective dose should be used . 
the injection should be subcutaneous use and the injection site should vary for the onset of lipoatrophies .

the somatropine may induce a resistance and in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been established in the following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , it may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration of T4 and an increase in the serum concentration of T3 . 
in general , the levels peripheral of hormones are in current to healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on the rate of hormones may have a clinical consequences for patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique central in which a theoretically hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is especially advised control thyroid function by initiation of therapy with the somatropine and following dose adjustment . 
a decrease in the levels of serum cortisol has been reported with the somatropine ; this may be related to changes in transport proteins or to an increase in hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope 
in case of severe somatotrope secondary to antitumour treatment , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with rare endocriniens , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequent in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe headache or repeated , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of oeil to dépister for swelling papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if appropriate , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
the present time do not recommend the course of continued therapy , the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared .

posology and method of administration 
the diagnosis and treatment with the somatropine should be performed and monitored by a physician experienced and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with growth retardation . 
22 La posology and method of administration should be appropriate for each patient . 
higher doses were observed . 
Prader-Willi syndrome , to improve the growth and statement area in paediatric patients : in general , the recommended dose is 0.035 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.0 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
the daily dose should not exceed 2.7 mg . 
paediatric patients with the rate of growth is less than 1 cm per year , including the épiphyses are almost soudées should not be treated . 
growth retardation in the Turner syndrome : the recommended dose is 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day , either 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day . 
growth retardation associated with chronic renal failure patients : the recommended dose is 1.4 mg / m2 of body surface area per day ( approximately 0,045 to 0.050 mg / kg body weight per day ) . 
higher doses can be used if the rate of growth is too low . 
it is possible that a dose adjustment is necessary after 6 months of therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . 
treatment should be discontinued after the first year of treatment if the rate of growth is less than 1 DS .

deficiency , growth hormone in adults : 
treatment should start with a low dose of 0.15 to 0.3 mg per day . 
the dose may be increased gradually over the needs of the patient , determined by the rate of IGF-1 in order to ensure concentrations IGF-1 , on the basis of age , above the upper limit of 2 DS . 
patients with the rise in IGF-1 is normal at the beginning of treatment should be given for the growth hormone up to a level of IGF-1 within sufficiently in excess of the normal range , not to exceed 2 DS . 
the clinical response in the same as undesirable effects may also guide the dose adjustment . 
the daily maintenance dose excède rarely 1.0 mg per day . 
women may need to doses higher than men ; men with an increase of the sensitivity of the IGF-1 over time . 
there is therefore a risk that women , particularly those with a replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens , are sous-dosées while males are surdosés . 
therefore , the correct dose adjustment within the hormone somatotrope should be checked every 6 months . 
physiological secretion of growth hormone decreasing with age , a reduction of dose as soon as possible .

special warnings and precautions for use 
the somatropine may induce a resistance and in some patients . 
in rare cases , the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been established in the following treatment with somatropine . 
in case of existing diabetes mellitus , it may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration of T4 and an increase in the serum concentration of T3 . 
in general , the levels peripheral of hormones are in current to healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on the rate of hormones may have a clinical consequences for patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique central in which a theoretically hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is especially advised control thyroid function by initiation of therapy with the somatropine and following dose adjustment . 
a decrease in the levels of serum cortisol has been reported with the somatropine ; this may be related to changes in transport proteins or to an increase in hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of severe somatotrope secondary to antitumour treatment , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with rare endocriniens , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequent in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe headache or repeated , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of eye to dépister for oedema papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if appropriate , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
24 recommend the course of continued therapy , the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
however , the clinical experience showed that the réintroduction of treatment was often possible without récurrence intracranial of hypertension . 
if treatment with the growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of the symptoms of an increase in blood pressure intracranial is required . 
in patients aged over 60 years of age , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be combined with energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting treatment with the somatropine in patients with a syndrome of Prader- Willi , for signs of occlusion airway , sleep disorder apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of occlusion airway , problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the hormone . 
the apnoea sleeping should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with methods reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during at , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of occlusion airway ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment of system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea sleeping is suspected . 
all patients who have a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infection , which should also be diagnosed and properly treated précocement as possible . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should also be monitoring pondéral prior to and during treatment with the hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop when growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of the scoliose during treatment with the hormone . 
the experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before starting treatment , then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a hyperglycaemia cause by mouth should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical event , growth hormone should not be given . 
25 Chez children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to measure the levels of IGF-l prior to initiating therapy , and subsequently 2 times a year . 
if on measures repeated , the levels of IGF-l &apos;s benefits are greater than 2 DS compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
the experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately prior to the onset of puberty in children neonates are small for gestational age is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy just before the onset of puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final solution should be reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal . 
prior to initiating therapy , to be confirmed delayed , the growth and it is in the past should be followed during 1 year before start of treatment . 
during this period , the treatment of chronic renal failure ( including control of the acidosis , hyperparathyroïdie and steady nutritionnel ) should have been observed and should be maintained during the course of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued in the event of kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent of patients with chronic renal failure patients treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
Etant due to the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients experiencing acute critique , the benefits of continuing treatment in this situation balance should be shown with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a critique acute other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine balance should be shown with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
due to the presence of benzyl alcohol , this medicinal product must not be given to prématurés or to either . 
it may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children aged less than 3 years . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of a drug interaction study performed in adults who have a deficiency , growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome p450 isoenzymes P450 . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical relevance of this effect is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and in section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there are no data on the use of this product in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animal studies on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in the event of pregnancy . 
in a pregnancy normal , the levels of growth hormone hypophysaire decline in high after 20 weeks gestation , these is remplacés almost completely by the growth hormone placental to approximately 30 weeks . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine should not be necessary in patients of low in growth hormone in women for the q3 of pregnancy . 
it is not known whether the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
Omnitrope should only be given with caution in women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
a reduction of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is started , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects associated with fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these effects are uncommon severe to moderate , they may occur in the first month of treatment and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these events is related to the administered dose and the age of patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in paediatric patients , these side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leucémies have been reported in paediatric patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency is similar to those in patients with no deficiency growth hormone . 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine resulted in the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low and their formation was of no clinical evidence . 
Affections hypothyroidism 
type 2 diabetes . 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
uncommon : 
hypertension intracranial bénigne . 
Affections musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders

uncommon : 
rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in adulte. rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in paediatric patients . 
general disorders and administration site conditions 
common : 
oedema peripheral in adults ; skin reactions focal and passagères at the site of injection for paediatric patients . 
uncommon : 
oedema peripheral in paediatric patients . 
overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the initial acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia , and no to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , term lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of excess growth hormone in humans . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : hormones of antéhypophyse and analogues . 
atc ATC : 
the somatropine is a potent jouant metabolic hormone play an important part in the metabolism of lipid , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates tumour growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing retention azotée in stimulating the growth of the muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentrations of IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties was evident . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of receptors hepatic of LDL-cholestérol , and change the lipid profile and lipoproteins serum levels . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone results in a decrease of LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum levels . 
a decrease in total cholesterol in the serum can also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but the fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
patients with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated with the administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the deficiency , growth hormone is associated with a reduction of volumes , and extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine results in a potassium and sodium retention , phosphorique . 
28 Métabolisme bone : 
the somatropine stimulates the bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density at the site of the treatment area increase after a long-term somatropine to patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
ability physical : 
the strength muscle and the patient &apos;s ability to exercise are améliorées following long term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also the heart rate , but the mechanism has not been elucidated . 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age , the dosage of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used for up to a final size . 
data from published studies suggest an late 0.5 DS in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age is not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety data are not available . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption La bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
following administration by the subcutaneous route of a dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope headache general disorders mg / ml solution for injection in healthy adult values of Cmax and tmax are by 72 28 g / l and 4.0 2.0 hours . 
ELIMINATION La a half life of the mean terminal somatropine is approximately 0.4 hours after administration intra- venous to adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope headache general disorders mg / ml solution for injection , the half-life is reached 3 hours . 
sous-population La absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in all patients in male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to obtain complete information about . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no studies of subaiguë toxicity and local tolerance with Omnitrope have revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no other general toxicology studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the studies of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in the mutation genetic technology and induction of chromosomal aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
it has been observed in a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro lymphocytes collected in patients following long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the medicinal product radiomimétique bleomycin .

in case of existing diabetes mellitus , it may need to change the diabetic treatment at the start of treatment with the somatropine . 
during treatment with the somatropine , an increase in the conversion of T4 in T3 has been observed , which leads to a reduction in the serum concentration of T4 and an increase in the serum concentration of T3 . 
in general , the levels peripheral of hormones are in current to healthy subjects . 
the effects of the somatropine on the rate of hormones may have a clinical consequences for patients with a hypothyroidism infraclinique central in which a theoretically hypothyroidism may develop . 
conversely , in patients receiving a replacement therapy with the thyroxine , hyperthyroidism moderate may occur . 
it is especially advised control thyroid function by initiation of therapy with the somatropine and following dose adjustment . 
a decrease in the levels of serum cortisol has been reported with the somatropine ; this may be related to changes in transport proteins or to an increase in hepatic clearance . 
it is possible that the clinical relevance of these findings is limited . 
however , the corticosteroids replacement should be optimisée before starting treatment with Omnitrope . 
in case of severe somatotrope secondary to antitumour treatment , it is recommended that the possible signs of recurrence of process tumoral . 
in patients with rare endocriniens , including those relatifs to deficiency growth hormone , the occurrence of a épiphysiolyse hip may be more frequent in the general population . 
any patient with a claudication during treatment with the somatropine should be examiné . 
in case of severe headache or repeated , visual disturbance , nausea and / or vomiting , it is recommended to perform a background of eye to dépister for oedema papillaire . 
if there is confirmed , diagnosis hypertension intracranial bénigne should be considered and , if appropriate , treatment with the somatropine should be discontinued . 
the present time do not recommend the course of continued therapy , the growth hormone in patients with hypertension intracranial has cleared . 
if treatment 
34 by growth hormone is réinstauré , careful monitoring of the occurrence of the symptoms of an increase in blood pressure intracranial is required . 
in patients aged over 60 years of age , the clinical experience is limited . 
in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi , treatment should always be combined with energy-restricted diet . 
patients with a SPW with one or more of these factors présenteraient an increased risk . 
before starting treatment with the somatropine in patients with a syndrome of Prader- Willi , for signs of occlusion airway , sleep disorder apnoea or respiratory infection , should be performed . 
in case of signs of occlusion airway , problem should be resolved by a specialist ORL prior to initiating therapy with the hormone . 
the apnoea sleeping should be evaluated prior to the initiation of therapy with the growth hormone with methods reconnues such as the polysomnographie or oxymétrie during at , and if it is suspected . 
if during treatment with the somatropine , patients experience signs of occlusion airway ( including the occurrence or aggravation of a ronflement ) , treatment should be discontinued and a new assessment of system ORL should be performed . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored if a apnoea sleeping is suspected . 
all patients who have a syndrome of Prader-Willi should be monitored for signs of infection , which should also be diagnosed and properly treated précocement as possible . 
all patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi should also be monitoring pondéral prior to and during treatment with the hormone . 
a scoliose is commonly observed in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi . 
in all children , the scoliose may develop when growth . 
signs of scoliose should be recherchés during treatment . 
however , there was no evidence of increased incidence or severity of the scoliose during treatment with the hormone . 
the experience a long term treatment with growth hormone in adults and in patients with a syndrome of Prader-Willi is limited . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , other causes or treatments may explain growth retardation should be excluded before instituting therapy . 
in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational , it is recommended to determine the insulinémie and fasting before starting treatment , then annuellement . 
in patients with an increased risk of diabetes ( a family history of diabetes , obesity , resistance severe Acanthosis nigricans ) , a hyperglycaemia cause by mouth should be performed . 
if a diabetes clinical event , growth hormone should not be given . 
if on measures repeated , 
35 of IGF-l &apos;s benefits are greater than 2 DS compared to standard to age and stage pubertaire , ratio IGF-l / IGFBP-3 should be taken into consideration for the dose adjustment . 
the experience with respect to the initiation of treatment immediately prior to the onset of puberty in children neonates are small for gestational age is limited . 
therefore , it is not recommended to initiating therapy just before the onset of puberty . 
the experience in patients with a syndrome of Silver Russel is limited . 
some of the gaining size in children / adolescents neonates are small to age gestational treated with growth hormone may disappear if treatment is discontinued before the final solution should be reached . 
in the case of renal failure , renal function should be reduced by 50 compared to normal . 
prior to initiating therapy , to be confirmed delayed , the growth and it is in the past should be followed during 1 year before start of treatment . 
during this period , the treatment of chronic renal failure ( including control of the acidosis , hyperparathyroïdie and steady nutritionnel ) should have been observed and should be maintained during the course of treatment . 
treatment should be discontinued in the event of kidney transplantation . 
there are no , to date , data available on the height permanent of patients with chronic renal failure patients treated with Omnitrope . 
because of these findings , these patients should not be treated with the somatropine . 
Etant due to the lack of information available on the safety of a replacement therapy with the growth hormone in patients experiencing acute critique , the benefits of continuing treatment with somatropinedans when balance should be shown with the potential risks . 
in all patients who develop a critique acute other or similar , the possible benefit of treatment with the somatropine balance should be shown with the potential risk . 
this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per ml , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
depending on the results of a drug interaction study performed in adults who have a deficiency , growth hormone , the administration of somatropine may increase the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome p450 isoenzymes P450 . 
in particular , the clearance of compounds metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( examples : sex hormones anabolic , corticosteroids , anticonvulsants and cyclosporin ) may be increased , resulting in a decrease in plasma levels of these compounds . 
the clinical relevance of this effect is unknown . 
refer to section 4.4 for diabetes and thyroïdiens , and in section 4.2 for information on the replacement therapy lyophilisate by oestrogens . 
pregnancy and lactation 
for Omnitrope there are no data on the use of this product in pregnant women . 
experimental data in animal studies on reproductive toxicity of Omnitrope are not available . 
treatment with Omnitrope should be discontinued in the event of pregnancy . 
therefore , a replacement by somatropine 
36 should not be necessary in patients of low in growth hormone in women for the q3 of pregnancy . 
it is not known whether the somatropine passes into human milk ; however , the gastrointestinal absorption of protein in the child is very unlikely . 
Omnitrope should only be given with caution in women who are breast-feeding . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
the effects on ability to drive and use machines have not been studied . 
undesirable effects 
a reduction of volume extracellulaire is observed in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
when initiating therapy with the somatropine is started , this decrease is rapidly corrected . 
undesirable effects associated with fluid retention , such as peripheral oedema , rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia , paraesthesia , are common in adult patients . 
in general , these effects are uncommon severe to moderate , they may occur in the first month of treatment and decline spontaneously or after a dose reduction . 
the frequency of these events is related to the administered dose and the age of patients ; it can be conversely related to age of patients during the development of a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in paediatric patients , these side effects are not common . 
neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) 
very rare : 
leukaemia . 
very rare cases of leucémies have been reported in paediatric patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and treated with the somatropine ; however , the frequency is similar to those in patients with no deficiency growth hormone . 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
formation of antibodies . 
the somatropine resulted in the formation of antibodies in approximately 1 of patients . 
the potential of binding of these antibodies is demeuré low and their formation was of no clinical evidence . 
Affections hypothyroidism 
type 2 diabetes . 
Affections nervous system disorders 
common : 
uncommon : 
paraesthesia in adulte. of the carpien syndrome in adults ; paraesthesia in the patient pédiatrique. hypertension intracranial bénigne . 
Affections musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
common : 
uncommon : 
rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in adulte. rigidity extremities , arthralgia , myalgia in paediatric patients . 
37 Troubles disorders and administration site conditions 
common : 
oedema peripheral in adults ; skin reactions focal and passagères at the site of injection for paediatric patients . 
uncommon : 
oedema peripheral in paediatric patients . 
overdose 
no case of overdose has been reported . 
the initial acute overdose may lead to hypoglycaemia , and no to hyperglycaemia . 
overdose may , term lead to signs and symptoms similar to the known effects of excess growth hormone in humans . 
PROPRIETES PHARMACOLOGIQUES 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : hormones of antéhypophyse and analogues . 
atc ATC : 
the somatropine is a potent jouant metabolic hormone play an important part in the metabolism of lipid , carbohydrates and proteins . 
the somatropine stimulates tumour growth linear and increases the growth rate in children with a deficiency , growth hormone . 
in adults , as in children , the somatropine keeps the statement area normal increasing retention azotée in stimulating the growth of the muscle , and mobilisant the body fat . 
fatty tissue viscéral is very sensitive to the somatropine . 
the somatropine increases the lipolysis and reduce the baseline levels within adequate lipid of the body . 
the somatropine increases the serum concentrations of IGF-1 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 ) and IGFBP3 ( Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 ) . 
in addition , the following properties was evident . 
lipid metabolism : 
the somatropine is an inducer of receptors hepatic of LDL-cholestérol , and change the lipid profile and lipoproteins serum levels . 
in general , the administration of somatropine in patients with a deficiency , growth hormone results in a decrease of LDL and apolipoprotéines B serum levels . 
a decrease in total cholesterol in the serum can also be observed . 
metabolism : 
the somatropine increases the levels of insulin , but the fasting blood glucose is generally unchanged . 
patients with a hypopituitarisme have sometimes episodes of hypoglycaemia when they are fasting , which may be treated with the administration of somatropine . 
metabolism hydroélectrolytique : 
the deficiency , growth hormone is associated with a reduction of volumes , and extracellulaire which increase rapidly with treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine results in a potassium and sodium retention , phosphorique . 
bone metabolism : 
the somatropine stimulates the bone turnover . 
the contents bone mineral and the density at the site of the treatment area increase after a long-term somatropine to patients with a deficiency , growth hormone and with a ostéopénie . 
ability physical : 
the strength muscle and the patient &apos;s ability to exercise are améliorées following long term treatment with the somatropine . 
the somatropine also the heart rate , but the mechanism has 
a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to this effect . 
in clinical studies in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age , the dosage of 0,033 and 0,067 mg / kg / day were used for up to a final size . 
data from published studies suggest an late 0.5 DS in children / adolescents neonates are small for gestational age is not treated and without rattrapage abortion early growth . 
the long-term safety data are not available . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
absorption La bioavailability of subcutaneous administration of somatropine is approximately 80 in healthy subjects and patients déficitaires in growth hormone . 
following administration by the subcutaneous route of a dose of 5 mg of Omnitrope from Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection in healthy adult values of Cmax and tmax are by 74 22 g / l and 3.9 1.2 hours . 
ELIMINATION La a half life of the mean terminal somatropine is approximately 0.4 hours after administration intra- venous to adult déficitaires in growth hormone . 
however , after subcutaneous administration of Omnitrope 6.7 mg / ml solution for injection , the half-life is reached 3 hours . 
sous-population La absolute bioavailability of the somatropine appears to be similar in all patients in male and female after subcutaneous administration . 
data on the pharmacokinetics of the somatropine in gériatrie , paediatric patients , for the different races and in patients with renal impairment or cardiac are either manquantes corresponding to obtain complete information about . 
preclinical safety data 
preclinical data reveal no studies of subaiguë toxicity and local tolerance with Omnitrope have revealed no special hazard for humans . 
preclinical data reveal no other general toxicology studies , local tolerance and toxicity to reproduction with somatropine did not reveal any clinically relevant effect . 
the studies of genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in the mutation genetic technology and induction of chromosomal aberrations were negative with somatropine . 
it has been observed in a chromosomal fragilité increased in a study in vitro lymphocytes collected in patients following long term treatment with the somatropine and who received the medicinal product radiomimétique bleomycin . 
the clinical relevance of this data is not clear . 
in another study , it has not been differences chromosomal where the risk of patients who had been treated with the somatropine long-term use .

what EST CE QU&apos; OMNITROPE ET DANS QUELS CAS EST-IL UTILISE 
Omnitrope is growth hormone human made by a method known as recombinant the ADN technology from the strain of E. coli . 
the structure is similar to those produced by the human body . 
Omnitrope 1.3 mg / ml is only for single use only . 
Omnitrope is used in the following 
treatment of infants , children and adolescents : 
- with growth retardation related to a lack of production of growth hormone . 
- with growth retardation related to a syndrome of Turner .

it is available as white capsules ( 200 and 400 mg ) . 
what is Onsenal used for ? 
Onsenal is used to reduce the number of polyps in patients with of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . 
it is a disease of polyps adénomateux genetic characterised by mouth , excroissances which develop from the lining of the colon or rectum . 
therefore , the 20 november 2001 , Onsenal was designated as an orphan medicine &apos; ( a medicine used in rare diseases ) . 
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . 
how to Onsenal used for ? 
the dose of Onsenal recommended dose is 400 mg twice daily , with a meal . 
the usual medical management in patients with FAP should be continued . 
in patients with moderate liver disease , the dose of Onsenal should be reduced by half and Onsenal should be used with caution in patients who have mild to moderate kidney function . 
Onsenal should not be given to patients who have severe kidney or liver problems . 
it should be used with caution , which may be at an initial dose of less than , in patients with the body assimile Onsenal slowly . 
special care should be taken in case of its use in the elderly . 
the maximum recommended daily dose of Onsenal is 800 mg . 
how to Onsenal expected to work ? 
the active substance in Onsenal , célécoxib , is an non-stéroïdien ( AINS ) that belongs to a group of the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
the célécoxib blocks an enzyme COX-2 , which has for effect a reduction of the production of prostaglandins , substances that 
reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. activities in process such as the inflammation and the activity of the muscle ( that plain muscle effectue tasks automatiques as opening and closure of the blood vessels ) . 
Quelles Onsenal studies have been studied ? 
Onsenal has been studied in one main study involving 83 adults with FAP , in whom the effectiveness of two doses of Onsenal was compared with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) . 
in the study , 25 patients had a colon ( lower intestine ) intact , but other had undergone a ablation surgery some or of the colon . 
the main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of polyps in one area defined of the colon or rectum after six months of treatment . 
an additional study was reproduction on the effects of Onsenal in 18 children with FAP . 
what benefit has demonstrated by Onsenal during the studies ? 
Onsenal , at a dose of 400 mg twice daily , was more effective than placebo . 
in adults , Onsenal was reduce the number mean polyps 28 after six months , while the number were reduced by 5 in placebo-treated patients . 
Onsenal was also reduces the number of polyps in children with FAP . 
what is the risk associated with the use of Onsenal ? 
the most common side effects seen with Onsenal ( in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and diarrhoea . 
for the full list of all side effects reported with Onsenal , see the package leaflet . 
Onsenal should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to célécoxib , any some of the other ingredients , or sulphonamides ( such as certain antibiotic ) . 
Onsenal should not be used in women who are pregnant or which may become in the absence of contraception , or to breast-feeding women . 
it must not be given to patients with severe liver disease or kidney function , in patients who have a disease causing inflammation of the gut or for patients with some problems affecting the heart or the blood vessels . 
for a full list of restrictions , see the package leaflet . 
why has Onsenal been approved ? 
the committee for medicinal products for human use ( CHMP ) decided that Onsenal &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for the reduction in the number of polyps mouth adénomateux in patients with FAP in addition to the surgery and monitoring endoscopique . 
the committee noted that no effects of a decreased number of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of developing a cancer of the intestine has been demonstrated . 
the committee recommended that be given marketing authorisation holder for Onsenal . 
Onsenal has been authorised under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; . 
this means that because of the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on Onsenal . 
every year , the european medicines agency ( Agence EMEA ) will review any new information that may become available and will be updated as necessary , this summary . 
Quelles information is still awaited for Onsenal ? 
the company that makes Onsenal will keep a study in patients with FAP to recueillir more information on the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product .

CLINIQUES data 
therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( PAF ) , in combination with surgery and in addition to standard endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of the reduction in the number and the size of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use and 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is two capsules of 200 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by half ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 Propriétés Contre-indications pharmacokinetic ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in such patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
the experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 Contre-indications Mises warnings and precautions for use and 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
paediatric population : 
2 Métaboliseurs poor of CYP2C9 : 
patients who are poor metabolisers the CYP2C9 or suspectés of be on the basis of the génotype or history / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution because the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) has not been established . 
special precautions for may be warranted in these patients ( see section 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
Contre-indications 
- Maladie inflammatory intestine . 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) , with the célécoxib has been studied in up to 6 months and has not been shown to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or another form of cancer or reduction in the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of monitoring endoscopique replacement should not be decreased to and during surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) should not be delayed . 
gastrointestinal disorders Des gastrointestinal complications &#91; perforations , ulcers , high or haemorrhage ( PUH ) &#93; , some with fatal outcome have been observed in patients treated with célécoxib . 
there is a potentiation of the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
3 Les patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) with a anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive concomitant therapy , including medicines or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after careful pharmacodynamic Propriétés ( see section 5.1 ) . 
because of their lack of antiplatelet effects , reversible maois COX-2 should be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases thromboembolic . 
therefore , the treatment should be anti-agrégants should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema was reported in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics , or with a risk of volume depletion . 
like all AINS , célécoxib may lead to the development of a blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , the blood pressure should be closely monitored at the start of treatment with célécoxib and throughout the course of treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , a attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the blood impaired , renal or hepatic impairment and especially with cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical monitoring should be established . 
renal and hepatic Affections Les AINS , including the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
the studies performed with the célécoxib showed renal effects similar to those observed with the AINS comparators . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , an impaired liver fonctionnelle and the elderly . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
the experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic impairment patients with mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 Posologie and method of administration pharmacokinetic Propriétés and 5.2 ) . 
4 Des appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration fonctionnelle system treatment listed during treatment . 
the risk of these effects appear to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment . 
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and Quincke oedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 Effets effects ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued at the first sign of skin rash , mucosal lining or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Les patients known to be poor metabolisers the CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin , haemorrhage reactions have been reported . 
caution should be taken in case of a combination of célécoxib with warfarin or other anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules to Onsenal 200 mg contain lactose ( 49,8 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency in LAPP or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction La majority interaction studies have been conducted with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg bid ( such as those observed in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice a day should therefore be excluded . 
the potency anti-coagulante should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , in particular the first few days following the initiation or change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , the use of oral anticoagulants must be accompanied by a close monitoring of prothrombin time INR of patients . 
the AINS may reduce the effect of diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , and as periodic . 
an increase in the nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked during concomitant administration of AINS with derivatives D cyclosporin or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored during concomitant use of célécoxib with any of these medicines . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but can not be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis monitoring . 
( see section 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
pharmacokinetic interactions 
effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products Le célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate of CYP2D6 , increased 136 . 
the plasma concentrations of substrates of the enzyme may be used in combination with the célécoxib . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2D6 are , for example , antidepressants ( tricycliques and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of substrates of CYP2D6 with the dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if need at the start of treatment with the célécoxib or increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies have shown that the célécoxib was may inhibit the catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is not known . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study , the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg of noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl ) . 
the célécoxib did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or the glibenclamide as clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics ( plasma clearance or renal ) , methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of toxicity in methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
in healthy subjects , the concomitant administration of 200 mg twice a day , célécoxib with 450 mg twice daily lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 of the Cmax and 18 of ASC of lithium . 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be closely monitored during the introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
6 Chez subjects who are poor metabolisers the CYP2C9 and which have an increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due to exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by the CYP2C9 , it should be used with half the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg of célécoxib and 200 mg once a day , fluconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean Cmax 60 and ASC of 130 of célécoxib . 
concomitant use with inducers CYP2C9 such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction Contre-indications ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 preclinical safety Données ) . 
the potential risk for the human is unknown . 
like other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , célécoxib may lead to an inertie utérine and closure of the prématurée in the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding to become pregnant during therapy , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal plasma . 
the administration of célécoxib to a limited number of women who are breast-feeding showed a very low levels of whether célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
it has not been performed studies to determine the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
undesirable effects 
adverse reactions are listed , by system organ class and classified by frequency in the Tableau 1 , on the basis of clinical sources following : 
- Les adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as comparator of AINS not beta- , approximately 7400 arthritiques have been treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
the side effects reported with the célécoxib in these studies have been cohérents with further in patients with rheumatoid arthritis arthrose and the Tableau 1 . 
- Les adverse reactions reported spontaneously after , period in 
which it is estimated to &gt; 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and indications ) . 
as all side effects are not reported in manufacturing AMM and included in the postmarketing period , it is difficult to determine whether in reliable the frequency of these side effects .

it is unlikely to be effective on a mean elimination half-life of the medicinal product due to its high protein binding . 
PHARMACOLOGIQUES properties 
pharmacodynamic properties 
pharmacotherapeutic group : 
antinéoplasiques , atc ATC : 
the célécoxib is a derivative of pyrazole substitué by two groupements aryl analogue chemical other sulphonamides non-arylaminiques ( e. g. thiazides , furosémide ) , but differently of sulphonamides arylaminiques ( e. g. sulfamethoxazole and other antibiotics sulphonamides ) . 
the célécoxib lyophilisate , is a selective inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) . 
no inhibition statistically significant COX-1 ( evaluated inhibition ex-vivo the formation of thromboxane B2 &#91; TxB2 &#93; ) has been observed in healthy volunteers over the therapeutic dose , familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) , of 400 mg twice a day . 
the cyclo-oxygénase is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins . 
two isoformes , COX-1 and COX-2 , have been identified . 
the cyclo-oxygénase-2 ( COX-2 ) is the isoform of the enzyme induced by a stimulus cytokines and is supposée be the major responsible for the synthesis of prostanoïdes mediators of pain , inflammation , and fever . 
high levels of COX-2 are found in there lesions pré-malignes ( such as polyps adénomateux colorectaux ) and cancers épithéliaux . 
the familial adenomatous polyposis ( PAF ) is a disease genetic due to a genetic autosomale dominante of gene suppresseur of tumour , gene APC ( Adenomatous Polyposis Coli ) . 
the polyps with of gene mutation APC and not treated surexprimant the COX-2 , continue of form , and is present in the colon or rectum with a risk of progression to colorectal cancer 100 . 
the COX-2 is also involved in ovulation , implantation and closure of the , régulation kidney function , and some of the central nervous system functions ( fever induction , your pain and cognitive function ) . 
it may also thought to play a role in ulcer healing of . 
the COX-2 was apparent in the in tissue around gastric ulcers in man but its implication in the in ulcer healing has not been established . 
the difference in antiplaquettaire activity between some AINS inhibitors COX-1 and selective the COX-2 may have a clinical significance in patients at risk of thromboembolic reactions . 
inhibitors of the COX-2 prostacycline reduce the formation of systemic ( and therefore possibly endothelial ) , to affect the platelet thromboxane . 
a dose dependent effect on the formation of TxB2 was observed at high doses of célécoxib . 
however , in healthy subjects and in studies with low effectif , with 600 mg twice daily , the célécoxib had no effect on platelet aggregation and bleeding time on the compared to placebo . 
inhibition of the COX-2 may affect the viabilité of the tumour without associated with inflammation . 
the célécoxib inhibits the formation of tumours in preclinical models of the colon , which surexpriment the COX-2 , induites chimiquement ( the model rat AOM ) or with mutation genetic ( the model mouse MIN ) . 
it was shown that the célécoxib to reduce the number and the size of polyps adénomateux colorectaux . 
a controlled , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , has been performed in patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) . 
the study population consisted of 58 patients who have had previously a colectomie or partial total and 25 patients had a colon intact . 
thirteen subjects had a phenotype attenuated for the familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) . 
a reduction of body surface adenomatous duodénale were no marked has also been observed compared to placebo ( 14,5 with célécoxib 400 mg twice daily versus 1.4 with placebo ) , however , there was not statistically significant . 
the results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of polyps in all treatment groups célécoxib compared to the groups correspondants treated with placebo . 
reducing the higher has been observed in patients treated with the célécoxib at doses of 16 mg / kg / day , which corresponds to the recommended dose of 800 mg daily in adult patients with a PAF . 
there have been examined in list by a Comité surveillance indépendant , conclu that the dose of célécoxib of 16 mg / kg / day was a dose safely to recommend for futures studies in adolescents with PAF . 
safety monitoring Etudes long-term involving subjects with polyps adénomateux sporadiques : 
two studies in subjects with polyps adénomateux sporadiques have been conducted with the célécoxib , the clinical trial APC ( prevention of adénome by the célécoxib ) and the clinical trial PreSAP ( prevention of polyps adénomateux spontaneous ) . 
the clinical trial APC has shown a dose-dependent increase of the composite ( expertisé ) with death cardiovascular , myocardial infarction and AVC with célécoxib compared with placebo for 3 years of treatment . 
the clinical trial PreSAP did not demonstrate statistically significant risk to the same composite endpoint . 
the combined for this composite over 3 years were 3.0 ( 20 cases / 671 subjects ) and 2.5 ( 17 cases / 685 subjects ) , against 0.9 ( 6 cases / 679 subjects ) for placebo . 
increases in both groups célécoxib and placebo , when expliquent primarily by an increased incidence of myocardial infarction . 
in the clinical trial PreSAP , the risk ratio compared to placebo for the same composite ( expertisé ) was 1.2 ( IC 95 0.6 2.4 ) with a daily dose of 400 mg célécoxib compared with placebo . 
the combined for this composite over 3 years were 2.3 ( 21 cases / 933 subjects ) , and 1.9 ( 12 cases / 628 subjects ) . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction ( expertisé ) was 1.0 ( 9 subjects / 933 ) with a daily dose of 400 mg célécoxib , compared to 0.6 ( 4 cases / 628 subjects ) with placebo . 
data from a third long-term called ADAPT ( The Alzheimer&apos; s Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial ) showed no significant increase in the cardiovascular risk associated with the twice-daily 200 mg of célécoxib compared with placebo . 
the hazard ratio compared to placebo for a composite similar ( death of CV , IDM , AVC ) was 1,14 ( IC 95 0.61 2.12 ) with a twice-daily 200 mg of célécoxib . 
the incidence of myocardial infarction was 1.1 ( 8 cases / 717 patients ) with a twice-daily 200 mg of célécoxib , against 1.2 ( 13 cases / 1070 patients ) with placebo . 
non-clinical data reveal no special laboratory tests pooled randomised controlled clinical trials suggest also as the cardiovascular risk may be associated with the use of célécoxib compared to placebo , indicating differences in the risk of the dose of célécoxib . 
12 Une of the marketing authorisation holder under exceptional circumstances this medicine has been authorised . 
this means that due to the rarity of this disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicine . 
the Agence product EMEA ) réévaluera each review any new information which may be provided , and if necessary this RCP should be started at day . 
pharmacokinetic properties 
the célécoxib is well absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations are attained by 2 to 3 hours approximately . 
the concomitant use with food ( high fat meal ) delays the absorption of approximately 1 hour with an increase in the absorption total ( ASC ) of 10 to 20 . 
the célécoxib is primarily eliminated by metabolism . 
less than 1 of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine . 
variability inter-sujets exposure to célécoxib is approximately 10-fold . 
at therapeutic doses , the pharmacokinetic profile célécoxib has a indépendant time and dose . 
the plasma protein binding is approximately 97 at therapeutic concentrations , and the célécoxib is not préférentiellement related to erythrocytes . 
the elimination half-life ranges from 8 to 12 hours . 
steady-state plasma concentrations are reached in less than 5 days of treatment . 
the pharmacological activity is attributed to the parent . 
main human metabolites present in the circulation did not activity décelable on the COX-1 or COX-2 . 
the metabolism of célécoxib is mainly bound to P450 CYP2C9 . 
three metabolites inactive as monoamine COX-1 or COX-2 , have been identified in human plasma , a alcohol packaging the carboxylique corresponding and its conjugate form . 
the activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 is reduced in people who have a polymorphisme genetic with to reduce the effect of enzymatic activity , as with any variantes homozygous of polymorphisme CYP2C9 3 . 
in three studies were conducted in 5 of subjects distinctes génotype CYP2C9 3 / 3 the AUC 0-24 of a single dose was increased to 3 times approximately metabolisers compared to normal . 
it is estimated to 0.3 to 1.0 the frequency of génotype 3 / 3 homozygote among different groups ethniques . 
patients who are poor metabolisers the CYP2C9 or suspectés of be on the basis of the history / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution ( see section 4.2 ) . 
there was no differences in clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of célécoxib between populations afro-américaine and caucasian . 
when a dose of 200 mg per day is administered , a in patients with moderate hepatic impairment were 41 and 146 . 
in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment , the metabolic capacity was well related to their serum albumin . 
in patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25-35 g / l ) , the daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by 50 . 
patients with severe hepatic impairment ( serum albumin &lt; 25g / l ) have not been studied , célécoxib is contraindicated in these patients . 
13 La pharmacokinetics of célécoxib has not been studied in patients with impaired renal function , but it should not be changed to influence in these patients , because it is extensively metabolised by the liver . 
there are limited data on the use of célécoxib in renal impairment and therefore , caution is recommended when treating patients with renal impairment . 
severe renal impairment is contraindication . 
preclinical safety data 
of hernies diaphragmatiques were also seen in a study of toxicity péri- and procedural natale in rats , which consisted of a exposure to product during the period of organogenèse . 
in the final study , at the lower exposure for this impaired occurred in one animal margin of safety was estimated to be 2 times the recommended daily dose in humans ( 800 mg ) . 
in animals , exposure to célécoxib during the early stages of embryonal caused of loss pre- and procedural implantatoires . 
these effects are expected due to inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats . 
in a study of péri- and procedural natalité in rats , and toxicity have been observed in the offspring . 
in a study of toxicity to two years , an increased incidence of thrombosis not surrénaliennes was observed at high doses in male rats .

PHARMACEUTIQUE form 
Gélules capsule white , opaque with two bandes has indicating 7767 and 400 . 
CLINIQUES data 
therapeutic indications 
Onsenal is indicated for the reduction in the number of polyps adénomateux mouth in the familial adenomatous polyposis ( PAF ) , in combination with surgery and in addition to standard endoscopique ( see section 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use ) . 
the effect of the reduction in the number and the size of polyps induced Onsenal on the risk of cancer gut has not been demonstrated ( see sections 4.4 Mises warnings and precautions for use ) . 
posology and method of administration 
the recommended oral dose is one capsule of 400 mg twice a day , taken during meals ( see section 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) should be continued during treatment with the célécoxib . 
the maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg . 
hepatic impairment : 
in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency ( serum albumin between 25 and 35 g / l ) , the recommended daily dose of célécoxib should be reduced by half ( see sections 4.3 and 5.2 Propriétés Contre-indications pharmacokinetic ) . 
caution is required in the absence of experience in such patients with doses greater than 200 mg . 
renal impairment : 
the experience with the célécoxib in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is limited , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 Contre-indications Mises warnings and precautions for use and 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
paediatric population : 
16 Métaboliseurs poor of CYP2C9 : 
patients who are poor metabolisers the CYP2C9 or suspectés of be on the basis of the génotype or history / experience with other substrates of CYP2C9 should receive the célécoxib with caution because the risk of dose-related adverse reactions is increased . 
a dose reduced at the start of treatment should be considered ( see section 5.2 ) . 
elderly : 
the dose in elderly patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) has not been established . 
special precautions for may be warranted in these patients ( see section 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
Contre-indications 
special warnings and precautions for use 
the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) , with the célécoxib has been studied in up to 6 months and has not been shown to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal cancer or another form of cancer or reduction in the need for a support surgery . 
therefore , the usual management of patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) should not be affected by the concomitant administration of célécoxib . 
in particular , the frequency of monitoring endoscopique replacement should not be decreased to and during surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) should not be delayed . 
there is a potentiation of the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( intestinal gastrointestinal ulceration or other gastrointestinal complications ) when the célécoxib is used in combination with acetylsalicylic acid ( even at low doses ) . 
a significant difference in the safety gastrointestinal between the combination reversible maois COX-2 / acetylsalicylic acid , and the combination AINS / acetylsalicylic acid has not been demonstrated in clinical trials long-term ( see section 5.1 ) . 
17 L&apos; combination of célécoxib and AINS other than aspirin should be avoided . 
patients with a familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) with a anastomose iléo-rectale or anastomose iléo-anale may develop ulceration anastomotiques . 
in case of ulcer anastomotique , patients should not receive concomitant therapy , including medicines or acetylsalicylic acid . 
patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events ( e. g. hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking , ) should be treated with the célécoxib only after careful pharmacodynamic Propriétés ( see section 5.1 ) . 
because of their lack of effects platelet , reversible maois COX-2 should be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases thromboembolic . 
therefore , the treatment should be anti-agrégant should not be discontinued ( see section 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
as with other medicinal products known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , fluid retention and oedema was reported in patients treated with the célécoxib . 
special are also necessary in patients treated with diuretics , or with a risk of volume depletion . 
like all AINS , célécoxib may lead to the development of a blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension , which may contribute to increase the incidence of cardiovascular events . 
therefore , the blood pressure should be closely monitored at the start of treatment with célécoxib and throughout the course of treatment . 
in the case of elderly patients with cardiac dysfunction mild to moderate requiring therapy , a attention and follow-up are justifiés . 
the blood impaired , renal or hepatic impairment and especially with cardiac dysfunction is more likely in elderly patients , consequently an appropriate medical monitoring should be established . 
renal and hepatic Affections Les AINS , including the célécoxib , may lead to renal toxicity . 
the studies performed with the célécoxib showed renal effects similar to those observed with the AINS comparators . 
patients at risk of toxicity earlier renal are those with impaired renal function , heart failure , an impaired liver fonctionnelle and the elderly . 
these patients should be closely monitored during treatment with célécoxib . 
18 L&apos; experience with the célécoxib in patients with renal or hepatic impairment patients with mild or moderate , is limited ; therefore , these patients should be treated with caution ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
the appropriate measures should be taken and discontinuation of treatment with célécoxib should be considered if there is some deterioration fonctionnelle a of organs treatment listed during treatment . 
skin reactions Des serious skin reactions , some with fatal outcome , dermatitis exfoliative , Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( Lyell ) , have been very rarely reported in association with the use of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
the risk of these effects appear to be the higher at the start of treatment , the occurrence of these events is situant in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment . 
serious hypersensitivity reactions ( anaphylaxis and Quincke oedema ) have been reported in patients receiving of célécoxib ( see section 4.8 ) . 
patients with a history of allergy sulphonamides or any other medicines may be at an increased risk of serious skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
treatment with célécoxib should be discontinued at the first sign of skin rash , mucosal lining or any other sign of hypersensitivity . 
other Les patients known to be poor metabolisers the CYP2C9 should be treated with caution ( see section 5.2 Propriétés pharmacokinetic ) . 
the célécoxib may mask fever and other signs of inflammation . 
in patients treated concomitantly with warfarin haemorrhage reactions have been reported . 
caution should be exercised when concomitant administration of célécoxib with warfarin and other oral anticoagulants ( see section 4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ) . 
the capsules to Onsenal 400 mg contain lactose ( 99,6 mg ) . 
patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency in LAPP or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine . 
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
pharmacodynamic interaction La majority interaction studies have been conducted with doses of célécoxib of 200 mg bid ( such as those observed in the arthrose and rheumatoid arthritis ) . 
a more pronounced with doses of 400 mg twice a day should therefore be excluded . 
the potency anti-coagulante should be monitored in patients taking warfarin or other anticoagulants , in particular the first few days following the initiation or change in dosage of célécoxib , as these patients have an increased risk of bleeding complications . 
for this reason , the use of oral anticoagulants must be accompanied by a close monitoring of prothrombin time INR of patients . 
19 Les AINS may reduce the effect of diuretics and anti-hypertenseurs . 
therefore , this combination should be administered with caution , especially in the elderly . 
patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be monitored renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy , and as periodic . 
an increase in the nephrotoxicity cyclosporin and tacrolimus has been evoked during concomitant administration of AINS with derivatives D cyclosporin or tacrolimus . 
renal function should be monitored during concomitant use of célécoxib with any of these medicines . 
the célécoxib can be used in combination with low dose acetylsalicylic acid , but can not be substituted for acetylsalicylic acid for prophylaxis monitoring . 
( see section 5.1 pharmacodynamic Propriétés ) . 
pharmacokinetic interactions 
effects of célécoxib on other medicinal products Le célécoxib is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome CYP2D6 . 
during treatment with the célécoxib , the mean plasma concentrations of dextromethorphan , substrate of CYP2D6 , increased 136 . 
the plasma concentrations of substrates of the enzyme may be used in combination with the célécoxib . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2D6 are , for example , antidepressants ( tricycliques and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) , neuroleptics , antiarrhythmics , etc . 
the dose of substrates of CYP2D6 with the dose is adjusted for each patient may be reduced if need at the start of treatment with the célécoxib or increased when stopping treatment with the célécoxib . 
in vitro studies have shown that the célécoxib was may inhibit the catalysed metabolism CYP2C19 . 
the clinical significance of this observation in vitro is not known . 
medicinal products metabolised by the CYP2C19 are , for example , diazepam , citalopram and imipramine . 
in an interaction study , the célécoxib had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives ( 1 mg of noréthisthérone / 35 g ethinyl ) . 
the célécoxib did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide ( substrate of cytochrome CYP2C9 ) or the glibenclamide as clinically relevant . 
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , célécoxib had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics ( plasma clearance or renal ) , methotrexate ( doses in rhumatologie ) . 
however , adequate monitoring of toxicity in methotrexate should be considered in the combination of these two medicinal products . 
20 Chez healthy subjects , the concomitant administration of 200 mg twice a day , célécoxib with 450 mg twice daily lithium , resulted in a mean increase 16 of the Cmax and 18 of ASC of lithium . 
therefore , patients receiving lithium should be closely monitored during the introduction or discontinuation of célécoxib . 
effects of other medicinal products on the célécoxib 
in patients who are poor metabolisers the CYP2C9 and which have an increased systemic exposure to célécoxib , concomitant therapy with inhibitors of CYP2C9 may lead to increases due to exposure to célécoxib . 
these combinations should be avoided in poor metabolisers shown of CYP2C9 ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . 
the célécoxib is mainly metabolised by the CYP2C9 , it should be used with half the recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole . 
concomitant use of a single dose of 200 mg of célécoxib and 200 mg once a day , fluconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 , resulted in a mean Cmax 60 and ASC of 130 of célécoxib . 
concomitant use with inducers CYP2C9 such as rifampicin , carbamazepine , or barbiturates may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of célécoxib . 
pregnancy and lactation 
there are no clinical data on exposed pregnancies at célécoxib . 
studies in animals ( rats and lapins ) have shown toxicity to reproduction Contre-indications ( see sections 4.3 and 5.3 preclinical safety Données ) . 
the potential risk for the human is unknown . 
like other medicinal products inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis , célécoxib may lead to an inertie utérine and closure of the prématurée in the last trimester . 
the célécoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential in the absence of contraception ( see section 4.3 Contre-indications ) . 
in case of finding to become pregnant during therapy , the célécoxib should be discontinued . 
the célécoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal plasma . 
the administration of célécoxib to a limited number of women who are breast-feeding showed a very low levels of whether célécoxib in breast milk . 
patients treated with the célécoxib should not breast-feed . 
effects on ability to drive and use machines 
it has not been performed studies to determine the effects on ability to drive and use machines . 
however , patients who experience dizziness , vertigo or somnolence when taking the célécoxib , should not drive or use machines . 
adverse reactions are listed , by system organ class and classified by frequency in the Tableau 1 , on the basis of clinical sources following : 
- Les adverse reactions reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to arthrose and 
in further studies using as comparator of AINS not beta- , approximately 7400 arthritiques have been treated with célécoxib up to 800 mg / day , including 2300 approximately were treated for at least 1 year . 
- Les adverse reactions reported spontaneously after , period in 
which it is estimated to &gt; 70 million the number of patients treated with the célécoxib ( different doses , and indications ) . 
as all side effects are not reported in manufacturing AMM and included in the postmarketing period , it is difficult to determine whether in reliable the frequency of these side effects .
