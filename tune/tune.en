further information
what Helixate NexGen 250 IU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
one vial with powder for solution for injection nominally contains 250 IU octocog alfa ( IU equals International Units ) .
after reconstitution with the appropriate volume of solvent ( water for injections ) , each vial contains octocog alfa 100 IU / ml .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : blood coagulation factor VIII ( ATC-Code B02B D02 ) .
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
this preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand &apos;s disease .
before YOU USE Helixate NexGen 250 IU
do not use Helixate NexGen 250 IU if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to octocog alfa , to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of Helixate NexGen 250 IU .
if you are unsure about this , ask your doctor .
take special care with Helixate NexGen 250 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction ( a severe , sudden allergic reaction ) .
if you experience tightness in the chest , feeling dizzy , feeling sick or faint , or experience dizziness on standing , you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to Helixate NexGen 250 IU .
if this occurs , stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice .
your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of Helixate NexGen 250 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels .
if your bleeding is not being controlled with Helixate NexGen 250 IU , consult your doctor immediately .
you may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this .
factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using .
this makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding .
56 If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products , you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back .
using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known .
however , please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of Helixate NexGen 250 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available .
therefore , if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product .
driving and using machines :
no effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed .
important information about some of the ingredients of Helixate NexGen 250 IU This medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per vial , i. e. essentially &quot; sodium- free &quot; .
how TO USE Helixate NexGen 250 IU
Helixate NexGen 250 IU is intended for intravenous administration only and must be administered immediately after reconstitution .
aseptic conditions ( meaning clean and germ free ) are required during reconstitution and administration .
use only the medical devices for reconstitution and administration provided with each package of Helixate NexGen 250 IU .
Helixate NexGen 250 IU must not be mixed with other infusion solutions .
do not use solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy .
follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide :
wash hands thoroughly using soap and warm water .
warm both unopened vials in your hands to a comfortable temperature ( do not exceed 37 C ) .
ensure product and diluent vial flip caps are removed and the stoppers are treated with an aseptic solution and allowed to dry
prior to opening the Mix2Vial package .
place the diluent vial on an even , clean surface and hold the vial tight .
take the Mix2Vial together with the package and snap the blue end onto the diluent stopper .
make sure that you only pull up the package and not the Mix2Vial set .
with the product vial firmly on a surface , invert the diluent vial with set attached and snap the transparent adapter onto the product vial stopper .
the diluent will automatically transfer into the product vial .
with the diluent and product vial still attached , gently swirl the product vial to ensure the product is fully dissolved .
do not shake vial .
with one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set and with the other hand grasp the diluent-side of the Mix2Vial set and unscrew the set into two pieces .
draw air ( 3 ml ) into an empty , sterile syringe .
pulling the plunger back slowly .
now that the concentrate has been transferred into the syringe , firmly grasp the barrel of the syringe ( keeping the syringe plunger facing down ) and disconnect the Mix2Vial set from the syringe .
hold the syringe upright and push the plunger until no air is left in the syringe .
puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster .
2 ml / min ) .
if a further dose needs to be administered , use a new syringe with product reconstituted as described above .
if no further dose is required , remove the venipuncture set and syringe .
hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx .
2 minutes .
finally , apply a small pressure dressing to the wound .
the amount of Helixate NexGen 250 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight , the severity of your haemophilia , the site and extent of bleeding , the amount of
he will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below .
required IU = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( of normal ) x 0.5
2 x administered IU body weight ( kg )
the following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels .
in the case of the haemorrhagic events listed , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level ( in of normal ) in the corresponding period :
degree of haemorrhage /
frequency of doses ( hours ) /
required ( ) ( IU / dl )
duration of therapy ( days )
haemorrhage
early haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or oral bleed
at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved .
more extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or haematoma
repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved .
life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed , throat bleed , severe abdominal bleed Surgery
repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
minor including tooth extraction
every 24 hours , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
major
- 100 ( pre- and
a ) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative )
your doctor should always adapt the amount of Helixate NexGen 250 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case .
under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required , especially in the case of the initial dose .
59 If you are using Helixate NexGen 250 IU to prevent bleeding ( prophylaxis ) , your doctor will calculate the dose for you .
this will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight , administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days .
however , in some cases , especially younger patients , shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary .
although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above , it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained .
in the case of major surgical interventions in particular , a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable .
if the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels , or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage , the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected .
by appropriate laboratory procedures , the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor .
if you have the impression that the effect of Helixate NexGen 250 IU is too strong or too weak , talk to your doctor .
patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of Helixate NexGen than previously to control a bleeding .
if this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product , factor VIIa concentrate or ( activated ) prothrombin complex concentrate .
do not increase the dose of Helixate NexGen you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor .
speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this .
these therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
Helixate NexGen 250 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes .
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient &apos;s comfort level ( maximal rate of infusion :
your doctor will tell you , how often and at what intervals Helixate NexGen 250 IU is to be administered .
usually , the substitution therapy with Helixate NexGen 250 IU is a life-time treatment .
if you use more Helixate NexGen 250 IU than you should :
no symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
if you have used more Helixate NexGen 250 IU than you should , please inform your doctor .
if you forget to use Helixate NexGen 250 IU : proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor . do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses .
if you stop using Helixate NexGen 250 IU Do not stop using Helixate NexGen 250 IU without consulting your doctor .
if you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Helixate NexGen 250 IU can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
furthermore , the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded .
if allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur , the injection / infusion should be stopped immediately .
please consult your doctor immediately .
during studies , no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation .
however , the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents , e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients .
the formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
in studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations , development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs .
you should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
in clinical studies , Helixate NexGen has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients ( PUPs ) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients ( MTPs , defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days ) .
five out of 37 ( 14 ) PUP and 4 out of 23 ( 17 ) MTP patients treated with Helixate NexGen developed inhibitors :
overall 6 out of 60 ( 10 ) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 ( 5 ) with a titer below 10 BU .
the median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days ( range 3 - 18 days ) .
4-478 ) .
four of the five patients , who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study , ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor .
the fifth patient was lost to follow-up .
in clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients ( PTP , defined as having more than 100 exposure days ) , followed over four years , no de-novo inhibitors were observed .
less than 0.2 PTP developed de-novo inhibitors .
in a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry , less than 11 developed de-novo inhibitors .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

what Helixate NexGen 1000 IU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
one vial with powder for solution for injection nominally contains 1000 IU octocog alfa ( IU equals International Units ) .
after reconstitution with the appropriate volume of solvent ( water for injections ) , each vial contains octocog alfa 400 IU / ml .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : blood coagulation factor VIII ( ATC-Code B02B D02 ) .
treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
this preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand &apos;s disease .
before YOU USE Helixate NexGen 1000 IU
do not use Helixate NexGen 1000 IU if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to octocog alfa , to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of Helixate NexGen 1000 IU .
if you are unsure about this , ask your doctor .
take special care with Helixate NexGen 1000 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction ( a severe , sudden allergic reaction ) .
if you experience tightness in the chest , feeling dizzy , feeling sick or faint , or experience dizziness on standing , you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to Helixate NexGen 1000 IU .
if this occurs , stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice .
your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of Helixate NexGen 1000 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels .
if your bleeding is not being controlled with Helixate NexGen 1000 IU , consult your doctor immediately .
you may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this .
factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using .
this makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding .
72 If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products , you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back .
using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known .
however , please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .

how TO USE Helixate NexGen 1000 IU
Helixate NexGen 1000 IU is intended for intravenous administration only and must be administered immediately after reconstitution .
aseptic conditions ( meaning clean and germ free ) are required during reconstitution and administration .
use only the medical devices for reconstitution and administration provided with each package of Helixate NexGen 1000 IU .
Helixate NexGen 1000 IU must not be mixed with other infusion solutions .
do not use solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy .
follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide :
wash hands thoroughly using soap and warm water .
warm both unopened vials in your hands to a comfortable temperature ( do not exceed 37 C ) .
ensure product and diluent vial flip caps are removed and the stoppers are treated with an aseptic solution and allowed to dry
prior to opening the Mix2Vial package .
place the diluent vial on an even , clean surface and hold the vial tight .
take the Mix2Vial together with the package and snap the blue end onto the diluent stopper .
make sure that you only pull up the package and not the Mix2Vial set .
with the product vial firmly on a surface , invert the diluent vial with set attached and snap the transparent adapter onto the product vial stopper .
the diluent will automatically transfer into the product vial .
with the diluent and product vial still attached , gently swirl the product vial to ensure the product is fully dissolved .
do not shake vial .
with one hand grasp the product-side of the Mix2Vial set and with the other hand grasp the diluent-side of the Mix2Vial set and unscrew the set into two pieces .
draw air ( 3 ml ) into an empty , sterile syringe .
pulling the plunger back slowly .
now that the concentrate has been transferred into the syringe , firmly grasp the barrel of the syringe ( keeping the syringe plunger facing down ) and disconnect the Mix2Vial set from the syringe .
hold the syringe upright and push the plunger until no air is left in the syringe .
puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster .
2 ml / min ) .
if a further dose needs to be administered , use a new syringe with product reconstituted as described above .
if no further dose is required , remove the venipuncture set and syringe .
hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx .
2 minutes .
finally , apply a small pressure dressing to the wound .
the amount of Helixate NexGen 1000 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight , the severity of your haemophilia , the site and extent of bleeding , the
he will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below .
required IU = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( of normal ) x 0.5
2 x administered IU body weight ( kg )
the following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels .
in the case of the haemorrhagic events listed , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level ( in of normal ) in the corresponding period :
degree of haemorrhage /
frequency of doses ( hours ) /
required ( ) ( IU / dl )
duration of therapy ( days )
haemorrhage
early haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or oral bleed
at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved .
more extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleed or haematoma
repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved .
life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed , throat bleed , severe abdominal bleed Surgery
repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
minor including tooth extraction
every 24 hours , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
major
- 100 ( pre- and
a ) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative )
your doctor should always adapt the amount of Helixate NexGen 1000 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case .
under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required , especially in the case of the initial dose .
75 If you are using Helixate NexGen 1000 IU to prevent bleeding ( prophylaxis ) , your doctor will calculate the dose for you .
this will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight , administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days .
however , in some cases , especially younger patients , shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary .
although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above , it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained .
in the case of major surgical interventions in particular , a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable .
if the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels , or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage , the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected .
by appropriate laboratory procedures , the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor .
if you have the impression that the effect of Helixate NexGen 1000 IU is too strong or too weak , talk to your doctor .
patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of Helixate NexGen than previously to control a bleeding .
if this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product , factor VIIa concentrate or ( activated ) prothrombin complex concentrate .
do not increase the dose of Helixate NexGen you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor .
speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this .
these therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
Helixate NexGen 1000 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes .
the rate of administration should be determined by the patient &apos;s comfort level ( maximal rate of infusion :
your doctor will tell you , how often and at what intervals Helixate NexGen 1000 IU is to be administered .
usually , the substitution therapy with Helixate NexGen 1000 IU is a life-time treatment .
if you use more Helixate NexGen 1000 IU than you should :
no symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
if you have used more Helixate NexGen 1000 IU than you should , please inform your doctor .
if you forget to use Helixate NexGen 1000 IU : proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor . do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses .
if you stop using Helixate NexGen 1000 IU Do not stop using Helixate NexGen 1000 IU without consulting your doctor .
if you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Helixate NexGen 1000 IU can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
furthermore , the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded .
if allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur , the injection / infusion should be stopped immediately .
please consult your doctor immediately .
during studies , no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation .
however , the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents , e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients .
the formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII ( inhibitors ) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
in studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations , development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs .
you should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests .
in clinical studies , Helixate NexGen has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients ( PUPs ) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients ( MTPs , defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days ) .
five out of 37 ( 14 ) PUP and 4 out of 23 ( 17 ) MTP patients treated with Helixate NexGen developed inhibitors :
overall 6 out of 60 ( 10 ) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 ( 5 ) with a titer below 10 BU .
the median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days ( range 3 - 18 days ) .
4-478 ) .
four of the five patients , who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study , ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor .
the fifth patient was lost to follow-up .
in clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients ( PTP , defined as having more than 100 exposure days ) , followed over four years , no de-novo inhibitors were observed .
less than 0.2 PTP developed de-novo inhibitors .
in a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry , less than 11 developed de-novo inhibitors .
if any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

what is Hepsera ?
Hepsera is a medicine containing the active substance adefovir dipivoxil .
it is available as white round tablets ( 10 mg ) .
what is Hepsera used for ?
Hepsera is used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long-term ) hepatitis B ( a disease of the liver due to infection with the hepatitis B virus ) .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Hepsera used ?
treatment with Hepsera should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of chronic hepatitis B.
the recommended dose is 10 mg once a day , taken with or without food .
the duration of treatment depends on the patient &apos;s condition and response to treatment .
these should be monitored every six months .
patients who have problems with their kidneys should take Hepsera less frequently .
Hepsera is not recommended for use in patients with severe kidney disease or who are on dialysis ( a blood clearing technique ) its use should only be considered in these patients if its potential benefits are greater than its potential risks .
a change to treatment should also be considered if levels of the virus remain high after a year of treatment with Hepsera on its own .
for more information , see the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) .
7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
how does Hepsera work ?
the active substance in Hepsera , adefovir dipivoxil , is a prodrug &apos; that is converted into adefovir in the body .
adefovir is an antiviral agent belonging to the class nucleoside analogues .
adefovir interferes with the action of a viral enzyme , DNA polymerase , which is involved in the formation of viral DNA .
adefovir stops the virus making DNA and prevents it from multiplying and spreading .
how has Hepsera been studied ?
Hepsera has been studied in two main studies , in which it was compared with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
in both studies , the effectiveness was measured by looking at how the liver damage had evolved after 48 weeks of treatment using a liver biopsy ( when a sample of liver tissue is taken and examined under a microscope ) .
studies have also examined the effectiveness of Hepsera in patients whose disease was resistant to lamivudine .
what benefit has Hepsera shown during the studies ?
Hepsera was more effective than placebo in slowing down the progression of liver disease .
among those who took Hepsera , 53 of the HBeAg positive and 64 of the HBeAg negative patients had an improvement in liver damage assessed in a biopsy , compared with 25 and 33 , respectively , in the patients who took placebo .
in the studies with lamivudine-resistant patients , treatment with Hepsera led to a decrease in the levels of viral DNA circulating in the blood .
what is the risk associated with Hepsera ?
the most common side effects with Hepsera ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are raised creatinine ( a marker of kidney problems ) and asthenia ( weakness ) .
for the full list of all side effects reported with Hepsera , see the Package Leaflet .
Hepsera should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to adefovir dipivoxil or any of the other ingredients .
why has Hepsera been approved ?
the Committee recommended that Hepsera be given marketing authorisation .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
Hepsera is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with :
compensated liver disease with evidence of active viral replication , persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) levels and histological evidence of active liver inflammation and fibrosis
decompensated liver disease .
posology and method of administration
therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of chronic hepatitis B.
the recommended dose of Hepsera is 10 mg ( one tablet ) once daily taken orally with or without food .
higher doses must not be administered .
the optimum duration of treatment is unknown .
the relationship between treatment response and long-term outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma or decompensated cirrhosis is not known .
patients should be monitored every six months for hepatitis B biochemical , virological and serological markers .
treatment discontinuation may be considered as follows :
in HBeAg negative ( pre-core mutant ) patients , treatment should be administered at least until HBsAg seroconversion or in case of evidence of loss of efficacy ( see section 4.4 ) .
2 In patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis , treatment cessation is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
children and adolescents :
Hepsera is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
no data are available to support a dose recommendation for patients over the age of 65 years ( see section 4.4 ) .
renal insufficiency :
adefovir is eliminated by renal excretion and adjustments of the dosing interval are required in patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml / min or on dialysis .
the recommended dosing frequency according to renal function must not be exceeded ( see sections 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
the proposed dose interval modification is based on extrapolation of limited data in patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) and may not be optimal .
patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml / min :
it is recommended to administer adefovir dipivoxil ( one 10 mg tablet ) every 48 hours in these patients .
there are only limited data on the safety and efficacy of this dosing interval adjustment guideline .
therefore , clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min and dialysis patients :
there are no safety and efficacy data to support the use of adefovir dipivoxil in patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min or on dialysis .
therefore , use of adefovir dipivoxil is not recommended in these patients and should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks .
these patients should be closely monitored for possible adverse reactions and to ensure efficacy is maintained ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
no dosing interval recommendations are available for other dialysis patients ( e. g. ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients ) or non-haemodialysed patients with creatinine clearance less than 10 ml / min .
no dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
clinical resistance :
adefovir may be used in combination with lamivudine in lamivudine-refractory patients and in patients harbouring HBV with mutations at rtL180M and / or rtM204I / V.
however , for patients harbouring HBV that contains the rtA181T mutation , consideration should be given to alternative treatment regimens due to the risk of reduced susceptibility to adefovir ( see section 5.1 ) .
in order to reduce the risk of resistance in patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy , a modification of treatment should be considered if serum HBV DNA remains above 1,000 copies / ml at or beyond 1 year of treatment .
Contraindications
hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
special warnings and precautions for use
renal function :
adefovir is excreted renally , by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion .
while the
it is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with adefovir dipivoxil .
in patients who develop renal insufficiency and have advanced liver disease or cirrhosis , dosing interval adjustment of adefovir or switch to an alternative therapy for hepatitis B infection should be considered .
treatment cessation for chronic hepatitis B in these patients is not recommended .
patients with normal renal function :
patients with normal renal function should be monitored for changes in serum creatinine every 3 months and creatinine clearance calculated .
in patients at risk of renal impairment ( see section 4.8 ) , consideration should be given to more frequent monitoring of renal function .
patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml / min :
the dosing interval of adefovir dipivoxil should be adjusted in these patients ( see section 4.2 ) .
in addition , renal function should be closely monitored with a frequency tailored to the individual patient &apos;s medical condition .
patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml / min and dialysis patients :
adefovir dipivoxil is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of &lt; 30 ml / min or on dialysis .
administration of adefovir dipivoxil in these patients should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks .
if treatment with adefovir dipivoxil is considered essential , then the dosing interval should be adjusted ( see section 4.2 ) .
these patients should be closely monitored for possible adverse reactions and to ensure efficacy is maintained .
patients receiving medicinal products that may affect renal function :
adefovir dipivoxil should not be administered concurrently with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( Viread ) .
co-administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil with medicinal products in these patients may lead to an increase in serum concentrations of either adefovir or a co-administered medicinal product .
the renal function of these patients should be closely monitored with a frequency tailored to the individual patient &apos;s medical condition .
for renal safety in patients pre- and post-transplantation with lamivudine-resistant HBV , see section 4.8 .
hepatic function :
spontaneous exacerbations in chronic hepatitis B are relatively common and are characterised by transient increases in serum ALT .
after initiating antiviral therapy , serum ALT may increase in some patients as serum HBV DNA levels decline .
in patients with compensated liver disease , these increases in serum ALT are generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or hepatic decompensation ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation following hepatitis exacerbation which may be fatal .
in these patients , including patients with decompensated liver disease , treatment cessation is not recommended and these patients should be monitored closely during therapy .
in the event of these patients developing renal insufficiency , see above Renal function .
if treatment cessation is necessary , patients should be closely monitored for several months after stopping treatment as exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of 10 mg adefovir
these exacerbations occurred in the absence of HBeAg seroconversion and presented as serum ALT elevations and increases in serum HBV DNA .
elevations in serum ALT that occurred in patients with compensated liver function treated with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil were not accompanied by clinical and laboratory changes associated with liver decompensation .
patients should be closely monitored after stopping treatment .
most post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis were seen within 12 weeks of discontinuation of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil .
lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis :
occurrences of lactic acidosis ( in the absence of hypoxaemia ) , sometimes fatal , usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues .
as adefovir is structurally related to nucleoside analogues , this risk cannot be excluded .
treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued when rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels , progressive hepatomegaly or metabolic / lactic acidosis of unknown aetiology occur .
benign digestive symptoms , such as nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain , might be indicative of lactic acidosis development .
severe cases , sometimes with fatal outcome , were associated with pancreatitis , liver failure / hepatic steatosis , renal failure and higher levels of serum lactate .
caution should be exercised when prescribing nucleoside analogues to any patient ( particularly obese women ) with hepatomegaly , hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease .
these patients should be followed closely .
Co-infection with hepatitis C or D :
there are no data on the efficacy of adefovir dipivoxil in patients co-infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis D.
Co-infection with HIV :
limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil in patients with chronic hepatitis B , co-infected with HIV .
to date there is no evidence that daily dosing with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil results in emergence of adefovir-associated resistance mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase .
nonetheless , there is a potential risk of selection of HIV strains resistant to adefovir with possible cross-resistance to other antiviral medicinal products .
treatment with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil has not been shown to be effective against HIV replication and therefore should not be used to control HIV infection .
elderly :
the clinical experience in patients &gt; 65 years of age is very limited .
resistance :
resistance to adefovir dipivoxil ( see section 5.1 ) can result in viral load rebound which may result in exacerbation of hepatitis B and , in the setting of diminished hepatic function , lead to liver decompensation and possible fatal outcome .
virological response should be closely monitored in patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil , with HBV DNA measured every 3 months .
if viral rebound occurs , resistance testing should be performed .
in case of emergence of resistance , treatment should be modified .
general :
patients should be advised that therapy with adefovir dipivoxil has not been proven to reduce the risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus to others and therefore appropriate precautions should still be taken .
Hepsera contains lactose monohydrate .
consequently , patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency , or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
interaction studies have only been performed in adults .
a pharmacokinetic interaction between adefovir and the immunosuppressant , cyclosporin , is also considered unlikely as cyclosporin shares the same metabolic pathway as tacrolimus .
nevertheless , given that tacrolimus and cyclosporin can affect renal function , close monitoring is recommended when either of these agents is coadministered with adefovir dipivoxil ( see section 4.4 ) .
concomitant administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil and 100 mg lamivudine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either medicinal product .
adefovir is excreted renally , by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion .
co-administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil with other medicinal products that are eliminated by tubular secretion or alter tubular function may increase serum concentrations of either adefovir or the co-administered medicinal product ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data on the concomitant use with other medicinal products ( including interferon ) are available .
pregnancy and lactation
there are no adequate data on the use of adefovir dipivoxil in pregnant women .
studies in animals administered adefovir intravenously have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
studies in orally dosed animals do not indicate teratogenic or foetotoxic effects .
adefovir dipivoxil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
there are no data on the effect of adefovir dipivoxil on transmission of HBV from mother to infant .
therefore , the standard recommended procedures for immunisation of infants should be followed to prevent neonatal acquisition of HBV .
given that the potential risks to developing human foetuses are unknown , it is recommended that women of child-bearing potential treated with adefovir dipivoxil use effective contraception .
lactation :
it is not known whether adefovir is excreted in human milk .
mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are taking adefovir dipivoxil tablets .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
however , based on the safety profile and mechanism of action , adefovir dipivoxil is expected to have no or negligible influence on these abilities .
undesirable effects
6 Assessment of adverse reactions is based on experience from post-marketing surveillance and from three pivotal clinical studies in patients with chronic hepatitis B :
the adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment are listed below , by body system organ class , and frequency .
within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
nervous system disorders :
common ( 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) : headache .
gastrointestinal disorders :
common ( 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) : diarrhoea , vomiting , abdominal pain , dyspepsia , nausea , flatulence .
frequency not known : pancreatitis .
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders :
common ( 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) : rash , pruritus .
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders :
frequency not known : myopathy , osteomalacia ( both associated with proximal renal tubulopathy ) .
renal and urinary disorders :
very common ( 1 / 10 ) : increases in creatinine .
common ( 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) : renal failure , abnormal renal function , hypophosphatemia .
Fanconi syndrome , proximal renal tubulopathy .
general disorders and administration site conditions :
very common ( 1 / 10 ) : asthenia .
exacerbation of hepatitis :
clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of treatment with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil ( see section 4.4 ) .
long-term safety data in patients with compensated disease :
in a long-term safety study of 125 HBeAg negative patients with compensated liver disease , the adverse event profile was overall unchanged after a median exposure of 226 weeks .
no clinically significant changes in renal function were observed .
however , mild to moderate increases in serum creatinine concentrations , hypophosphatemia and a decrease in carnitine concentrations were reported in 3 , 4 and 6 of patients , respectively , on extended treatment .
patients with a confirmed increase in creatinine of 0.3 mg / dl by week 48 were at a statistically significant higher risk of a subsequent confirmed increase in creatinine of 0.5 mg / dl .
hypophosphatemia and a decrease in carnitine concentrations were reported each in 3 of patients on extended treatment .
7 Safety in patients with decompensated disease :
in patients with decompensated liver disease , the most frequently reported adverse reactions during up to 203 weeks of adefovir dipivoxil therapy were increased creatinine ( 7 ) and asthenia ( 5 ) .
renal toxicity is an important feature of the safety profile of adefovir dipivoxil in patients with decompensated liver disease .
in clinical studies of wait-listed and post-liver transplantation patients , four percent ( 19 / 467 ) of patients discontinued treatment with adefovir dipivoxil due to renal adverse events .
overdose
administration of 500 mg adefovir dipivoxil daily for 2 weeks and 250 mg daily for 12 weeks has been associated with the gastrointestinal disorders listed above and anorexia .
if overdose occurs , the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity , and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary .
adefovir can be removed by haemodialysis ; the median haemodialysis clearance of adefovir is 104 ml / min .
the elimination of adefovir by peritoneal dialysis has not been studied .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors , ATC code :
adefovir dipivoxil is an oral prodrug of adefovir , an acyclic nucleotide phosphonate analogue of adenosine monophosphate , which is actively transported into mammalian cells where it is converted by host enzymes to adefovir diphosphate .
adefovir diphosphate inhibits viral polymerases by competing for direct binding with the natural substrate ( deoxyadenosine triphosphate ) and , after incorporation into viral DNA , causes DNA chain termination .
adefovir diphosphate selectively inhibits HBV DNA polymerases at concentrations 12- , 700- , and 10-fold lower than those needed to inhibit human DNA polymerases , , and , respectively .
adefovir diphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 12 to 36 hours in activated and resting lymphocytes .
clinical experience :
the demonstration of the benefit of adefovir dipivoxil is based on histological , virological , biochemical , and serological responses in adults with :
HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease .
lamivudine-resistant HBV with either compensated or decompensated liver disease , including patients pre- and post-liver transplantation or co-infected with HIV .
in the majority of these studies adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg was added to ongoing lamivudine treatment in patients failing lamivudine therapy .
in these clinical studies patients had active viral replication ( HBV DNA 100,000 copies / ml ) and elevated ALT levels ( 1.2 x Upper Limit of Normal ( ULN ) ) .
experience in patients with compensated liver disease :
improvement was defined as a reduction from baseline of two points or more in the Knodell necro-inflammatory score with no concurrent worsening in the Knodell fibrosis score .
histological improvement was seen regardless of baseline demographic and hepatitis B characteristics , including prior interferon-alpha therapy .
blinded , ranked assessments of both necro- inflammatory activity and fibrosis at baseline and week 48 , demonstrated that patients treated with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil had improved necro-inflammatory and fibrosis scores relative to placebo- treated patients .
in most patients who stopped treatment with adefovir dipivoxil , serum HBV DNA and ALT levels returned towards baseline .
treatment with adefovir dipivoxil resulted in improvement in the liver fibrosis from baseline to 96 weeks therapy when analysed using the Ishak score ( median change :
no differences in the median fibrosis score were seen between groups using the Knodell fibrosis score .
serum HBV DNA levels remained undetectable and ALT levels normalised in approximately two thirds of patients following treatment with adefovir dipivoxil for up to 240 weeks .
by the end of the study , 7 of 12 patients ( 58 ) with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis at baseline , had an improved Ishak fibrosis score of 2 points .
five patients achieved and maintained HBsAg seroconversion ( HBsAg negative / HBsAb positive ) .
experience in patients pre- and post-liver transplantation with lamivudine-resistant HBV :
in the pre-liver transplantation and post-liver transplantation cohorts 77 of 109 ( 71 ) patients and 64 of 159 ( 40 ) patients , respectively , achieved undetectable HBV DNA levels at week 48 ( &lt; 1,000 copies / ml Roche Amplicor Monitor PCR assay ) .
treatment with 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil showed similar
improvements or stabilisation were seen in Child-Pugh-Turcotte score .
normalisation of ALT , albumin , bilirubin and prothrombin time was seen at week 48 in 51-85 of the patients .
in the pre-liver transplantation cohort , 25 of 33 ( 76 ) patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA levels and 84 of patients had ALT normalisation at 96 weeks .
the clinical significance of these findings as they relate to histological improvement is not known .
experience in patients with compensated liver disease and lamivudine-resistant HBV :
the clinical significance of these observed changes in HBV DNA has not been established .
experience in patients with decompensated liver disease and lamivudine-resistant HBV :
improvement in liver function was also seen after one year of therapy .
experience in patients with HIV co-infection and lamivudine-resistant HBV :
in a second open-label , one-arm study , 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil and pegylated interferon alpha-2a were added to ongoing lamivudine therapy in 18 HIV / HBV co-infected patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV .
patients were all HBeAg positive and had median CD4 cell count of 441 cells / mm3 ( no patient had CD4 count &lt; 200 cells / mm3 ) .
during therapy , serum HBV DNA levels were significantly lower compared to baseline for up to 48 weeks of treatment while ALT levels declined progressively from week 12 .
however , on-treatment HBV DNA response was not maintained off-therapy since all the patients had a rebound in HBV DNA after adefovir dipivoxil and pegylated interferon alpha-2a discontinuation .
no patients became HBsAg- or HBeAg-negative during the study .
paediatric population :
however , the proportions of subjects who achieved HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 were similar ( 11 ) between the placebo arm and the adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg arm in adolescent patients .
10 Overall , the safety profile of adefovir dipivoxil in children was consistent with the known safety profile in adult patients .
however , a signal towards a higher rate of decreased appetite and / or food intake was observed in the adefovir arm as compared to the placebo arm .
at week 48 and 96 , mean changes from baseline in weight and BMI Z scores tended to decrease in adefovir dipivoxil-treated patients .
no long-term safety data or long-term resistance data are available with adefovir dipivoxil in children .
the clinical data available are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions on the benefit / risk ratio of the adefovir treatment in children with chronic hepatitis B ( see section 4.2 ) .
clinical resistance in patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil as monotherapy and in combination with lamivudine :
no HBV DNA polymerase mutations associated with resistance to adefovir were identified when patients were genotyped at baseline and at week 48 .
after 96 , 144 , 192 and 240 weeks of treatment with adefovir dipivoxil , resistance surveillance was performed for 293 , 221 , 116 and 64 patients , respectively .
two novel conserved site mutations were identified in the HBV polymerase gene ( rtN236T and rtA181V ) , which conferred clinical resistance to adefovir dipivoxil .
the cumulative probabilities of developing these adefovir-associated resistance mutations in all patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil were 0 at 48 weeks and approximately 2 , 7 , 14 and 25 after 96 , 144 , 192 and 240 weeks , respectively .
clinical resistance in monotherapy studies in nucleoside naïve patients :
clinical resistance in studies where adefovir dipivoxil was added to ongoing lamivudine in patients with lamivudine-resistance :
in an open-label study of pre- and post-liver transplantation patients with clinical evidence of lamivudine-resistant HBV , no adefovir-associated resistance mutations were observed at week 48 .
with up to 3 years of exposure , no patients receiving both adefovir dipivoxil and lamivudine developed resistance to adefovir dipivoxil .
however , 4 patients who discontinued lamivudine treatment developed the rtN236T mutation while receiving adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy and all experienced serum HBV rebound .
the currently available data both in vitro and in patients suggest that HBV expressing the adefovir- associated resistance mutation rtN236T is susceptible to lamivudine .
preliminary clinical data suggest the adefovir-associated resistance mutation rtA181V may confer a reduced susceptibility to lamivudine , and the lamivudine-associated mutation rtA181T may confer a reduced susceptibility to adefovir dipivoxil .
pharmacokinetic properties
adefovir dipivoxil is a dipivaloyloxymethyl ester prodrug of the active substance adefovir .
the oral bioavailability of adefovir from 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil is 59 .
following oral administration of a single dose of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil to chronic hepatitis B patients , the median ( range ) peak serum concentration ( Cmax ) was achieved after 1.75 h ( 0.58-4.0 h ) .
median Cmax and AUC0- values were 16.70 ( 9.66-30.56 ) ng / ml and 204.40 ( 109.75-356.05 ) ng h / ml , respectively .
systemic exposure to adefovir was not affected when 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil was taken with a high fat meal .
the tmax was delayed by two hours .
11 Distribution :
preclinical studies show that after oral administration of adefovir dipivoxil , adefovir is distributed to most tissues with the highest concentrations occurring in kidney , liver and intestinal tissues .
in vitro binding of adefovir to human plasma or human serum proteins is 4 , over the adefovir concentration range of 0.1 to 25 g / ml .
the volume of distribution at steady-state following intravenous administration of 1.0 or 3.0 mg / kg / day is 392 75 and 352 9 ml / kg , respectively .
following oral administration , adefovir dipivoxil is rapidly converted to adefovir .
at concentrations substantially higher ( &gt; 4,000-fold ) than those observed in vivo , adefovir did not inhibit any of the following human CYP450 isoforms , CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A4 .
based on the results of these in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of adefovir , the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving adefovir with other medicinal products is low .
adefovir is excreted renally by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion .
after repeated administration of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil , 45 of the dose is recovered as adefovir in the urine over 24 hours .
plasma adefovir concentrations declined in a biexponential manner with a median terminal elimination half-life of 7.22 h ( 4.72-10.70 h ) .
linearity / non-linearity :
the pharmacokinetics of adefovir are proportional to dose when given as adefovir dipivoxil over the dose range of 10 to 60 mg .
repeated dosing of adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily did not influence the pharmacokinetics of adefovir .
gender , age and ethnicity :
the pharmacokinetics of adefovir were similar in male and female patients .
pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in children or in the elderly .
pharmacokinetic studies were principally conducted in Caucasian patients .
the available data do not appear to indicate any difference in pharmacokinetics with regard to race .
the pharmacokinetics of adefovir dipivoxil were studied in an efficacy and safety study of a daily dose of 0.25 mg / kg to 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil in children ( aged 2 to &lt; 18 years ) .
renal impairment :
the mean ( SD ) pharmacokinetic parameters of adefovir following administration of a single dose of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil to patients with varying degrees of renal impairment are described in the table below :
moderate
baseline Creatinine
clearance ( ml / min )
( n = 7 ) ( n = 8 ) ( n = 7 )
Cmax ( ng / ml )
22.4 4.0
28.5 8.6
51.6 10.3
AUC0- ( ng h / ml ) CL / F ( ml / min ) CLrenal ( ml / min )
201 40.8 469 99.0 231 48.9
266 55.7 356 85.6 148 39.3
455 176 237 118 83.9 27.5
1240 629 91.7 51.3 37.0 18.4
a four-hour period of haemodialysis removed approximately 35 of the adefovir dose .
the effect of peritoneal dialysis on adefovir removal has not been evaluated .
12 It is recommended that the dosing interval of 10 mg adefovir dipivoxil is modified in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml / min .
adefovir dipivoxil is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance of &lt; 30 ml / min or in patients on dialysis ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
hepatic impairment :
pharmacokinetic properties were similar in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers ( see section 4.2 ) .
preclinical safety data
the primary dose-limiting toxic effect associated with administration of adefovir dipivoxil in animals ( mice , rats and monkeys ) was renal tubular nephropathy characterised by histological alterations and / or increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine .
nephrotoxicity was observed in animals at systemic exposures at least 3-10 times higher than those achieved in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose of 10 mg / day .
no effects on male or female fertility , or reproductive performance , occurred in rats and there was no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in rats or rabbits administered adefovir dipivoxil orally .
no adverse effects on development were seen at systemic exposures approximately 12 times that achieved in humans at the therapeutic dose .
adefovir dipivoxil was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay ( with or without metabolic activation ) , but was not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
adefovir was not mutagenic in microbial mutagenicity assays involving Salmonella typhimurium ( Ames ) and Escherichia coli in the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
adefovir induced chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte assay without metabolic activation .

European PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT ( EPAR )
EPAR summary for the public
this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EPAR ) .
it explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
if you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
if you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
what is Herceptin ?
Herceptin is a powder that is made up into a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
it contains the active substance trastuzumab .
what is Herceptin used for ?
Herceptin is used to treat breast cancer .
it can only be used when the cancer has been shown to express &apos; HER2 : this means that the cancer produces a specific protein called HER2 in large quantities on the surface of the tumour cells .
in early breast cancer , Herceptin is used after surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy ( if applicable ) .
the medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
how is Herceptin used ?
Herceptin treatment should only be started by a doctor who has experience in the use of anticancer medicines .
the infusion can be associated with allergic reactions , so the patient should be monitored during and after the infusion .
for metastatic cancer , Herceptin is given every week or every three weeks , and the treatment is continued for as long as it remains effective .
for early cancer , Herceptin is given every three weeks for a year or until it stops being effective .
Herceptin can also be given weekly when used in combination with other anticancer medicines .
for full details , see the Summary of Product Characteristics ( also part of the EPAR ) .
trastuzumab has been designed to bind to 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
HER2 , a receptor for epidermal growth factor , which is found on the surface of certain tumour cells .
by binding to the receptor , trastuzumab activates certain cells of the immune system ( the body &apos; s natural defences ) , which then kill the tumour cells .
trastuzumab also prevents HER2 from breaking , which otherwise leads to a signal for the tumour cells to grow .
about a quarter of breast cancers express large amounts of HER2 .
how has Herceptin been studied ?
all studies of Herceptin have been in cancers that express HER2 .
in metastatic breast cancer , Herceptin given once a week has been studied in four main studies .
these studies measured how many patients responded to treatment .
the fourth study compared the combination of Herceptin and anastrozole ( an aromatase inhibitor ) with anastrozole alone in 208 patients .
the main measure of effectiveness was the median progression-free survival &apos; ( the length of time until 50 of the patients had experienced a worsening of their disease or had died ) .
in early breast cancer , Herceptin has been studied over one to two years in one main study that involved over 3,000 patients who had been first treated with surgery , chemotherapy or radiotherapy .
half of the patients received Herceptin , while the other half did not receive it .
the study measured the time until the cancer re-appeared anywhere in the body .
what benefit has Herceptin shown during the studies ?
in metastatic breast cancer , the first study showed that 15 of the patients who had failed on other types of chemotherapy responded to Herceptin .
when Herceptin was used in addition to paclitaxel , the response rate was 48 , compared with 17 for paclitaxel on its own .
with docetaxel , 61 of the patients responded , compared with 34 for docetaxel on its own .
when Herceptin was used in combination with anastrozole , the median progression-free survival was 4.8 months , compared with 2.4 months in the patients taking anastrozole on its own .
the additional studies showed that the effectiveness of three-weekly Herceptin was similar to that seen in studies of once-weekly Herceptin .
in the study in early breast cancer , the risk of the cancer coming back within the first year was reduced by about half :
of the patients who received Herceptin experienced a re-appearance of their cancer ( 127 out of 1,693 ) , compared with 13 of the patients who did not receive it ( 219 out of 1,693 ) .
what is the risk associated with Herceptin ?
Herceptin can cause cardiotoxicity ( harm to the heart ) , including heart failure .
care should be taken if it is given to patients who already have heart problems , and all patients need to be monitored during treatment to check their heart .
for the full list of all side effects reported with Herceptin , see the Package Leaflet .
Herceptin should not be used in people who are hypersensitive ( allergic ) to trastuzumab or to any of the other ingredients .
it should also not be used in patients who have serious breathing problems when they are at rest because of their cancer , or who need oxygen therapy .
why has Herceptin been approved ?
the Committee recommended that Herceptin be given marketing authorisation .
which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Herceptin ?
the company that makes Herceptin will carry out more studies looking at cardiotoxicity , including looking at the guidance supplied to doctors and how to identify patients at risk of heart problems to ensure that they are carefully monitored .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
metastatic Breast Cancer ( MBC )
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2 :
a ) as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease .
prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments .
hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy , unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments .
B ) in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable .
C ) in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease .
d ) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer , not previously treated with trastuzumab .
early Breast Cancer ( EBC )
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer following surgery , chemotherapy ( neoadjuvant or adjuvant ) and radiotherapy ( if applicable ) ( see 5.1 ) .
Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay ( see 4.4 and 5.1 ) .
posology and method of administration
HER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of Herceptin therapy ( see 4.4 and 5.1 ) .
Herceptin treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy ( see 4.4 ) .
MBC Weekly schedule :
the following loading and subsequent doses are recommended for monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel or an aromatase inhibitor .
loading dose The recommended initial loading dose of Herceptin is 4 mg / kg body weight .
subsequent doses The recommended weekly dose of Herceptin is 2 mg / kg body weight , beginning one week after the loading dose .
method of administration Herceptin is administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion .
patients should be observed for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the start of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever and chills or other infusion-related symptoms ( see 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
the infusion may be resumed when symptoms abate .
if the initial loading dose was well tolerated , the subsequent doses can be administered as a 30-minute infusion .
emergency equipment must be available .
administration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor In the pivotal trial Herceptin and anastrozole were administered from day 1 .
there were no restrictions on the relative timing of Herceptin and anastrozole at administration ( for dose , see the Summary of Product Characteristics for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors ) .
duration of treatment Herceptin should be administered until progression of disease .
MBC 3-weekly schedule :
alternatively the following loading and subsequent doses are recommended for monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel , docetaxel or an aromatase inhibitor .
initial loading dose of 8 mg / kg body weight , followed by 6 mg / kg body weight 3 weeks later and then 6 mg / kg repeated at 3-weekly intervals administered as infusions over approximately 90 minutes .
duration of treatment Herceptin should be administered until progression of disease .
EBC 3-weekly schedule :
in the HERA trial , Herceptin was initiated after completions of standard chemotherapy ( most commonly , anthracycline-containing regimens or anthracyclines plus a taxane ) .
3 Initial loading dose of 8 mg / kg body weight , followed by 6 mg / kg body weight 3 weeks later and then 6 mg / kg repeated at 3-weekly intervals administered as infusions over approximately 90 minutes .
patients with early breast cancer should be treated for 1 year or until disease recurrence .
EBC weekly schedule :
MBC and EBC :
do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus .
for instructions for use and handling refer to 6.6 .
dose reduction No reductions in the dose of Herceptin were made during clinical trials .
patients may continue Herceptin therapy during periods of reversible , chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be monitored carefully for complications of neutropenia during this time .
refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for paclitaxel , docetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays .
subsequent maintenance Herceptin doses of 6 mg / kg should then be given every 3 weeks , according to the previous schedule .
if the patient misses a dose of Herceptin by more than one week , a re-loading dose of Herceptin should be given ( 8 mg / kg over approximately 90 minutes ) .
subsequent maintenance Herceptin doses of 6 mg / kg should then be given every 3 weeks from that point .
special patient populations Clinical data show that the disposition of Herceptin is not altered based on age or serum creatinine ( see 5.2 ) .
in clinical trials , elderly patients did not receive reduced doses of Herceptin .
dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have not been carried out .
however in a population pharmacokinetic analysis , age and renal impairment were not shown to affect trastuzumab disposition .
paediatric use Herceptin is not recommended for use in children below 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Contraindications
patients with known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab , murine proteins , or to any of the excipients .
patients with severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy .
special warnings and precautions for use
HER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of the testing procedures ( see 5.1 ) .
4 Currently no data from clinical trials are available on Herceptin re-treatment of patients with previous exposure to Herceptin in the adjuvant setting .
the use of Herceptin is associated with cardiotoxicity .
all candidates for treatment should undergo careful cardiac monitoring ( see &quot; cardiotoxicity &quot; section below ) . the risk of cardiotoxicity is greatest when Herceptin is used in combination with anthracyclines .
therefore Herceptin and anthracyclines should not be used currently in combination except in a well-controlled clinical trial setting with cardiac monitoring .
patients who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiotoxicity with Herceptin treatment , although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of Herceptin and anthracyclines .
because the half-life of Herceptin is approximately 28.5 days ( 95 confidence interval , 25.5 32.8 days ) , Herceptin may persist in the circulation for up to 24 weeks after stopping Herceptin treatment .
patients who receive anthracyclines after stopping Herceptin may possibly be at increased risk of cardiotoxicity .
if possible , physicians should avoid anthracycline- based therapy for up to 24 weeks after stopping Herceptin .
if anthracyclines are used , the patient &apos;s cardiac function should be monitored carefully ( see &quot; cardiotoxicity &quot; section below ) .
serious adverse reactions including infusion reactions , hypersensitivity , allergic-like reactions and pulmonary events have been observed in patients receiving Herceptin therapy .
patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction .
these severe reactions were usually associated with the first infusion of Herceptin and generally occurred during or immediately following the infusion .
for some patients , symptoms progressively worsened and led to further pulmonary complications .
initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical deterioration have also been reported .
fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week following infusion .
on very rare occasions , patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms or pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the Herceptin infusion .
patients should be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their physician if these symptoms occur .
the majority of these events occur during or within 2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion .
should an infusion reaction occur the Herceptin infusion should be discontinued and the patient monitored until resolution of any observed symptoms ( see 4.2 ) .
the majority of patients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of Herceptin .
serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen , beta-agonists , and corticosteroids .
in rare cases , these reactions are associated with a clinical course culminating in a fatal outcome .
patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction .
therefore , these patients should not be treated with Herceptin ( see 4.3 ) .
pulmonary events Severe pulmonary events have been reported rarely with the use of Herceptin in the post-marketing setting ( see 4.8 ) .
these rare events have occasionally been fatal .
in addition , rare cases of pulmonary infiltrates , acute respiratory distress syndrome , pneumonia , pneumonitis , pleural effusion , respiratory distress , acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been reported .
these events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or with a delayed onset .
patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events .
therefore , these patients should not be treated with Herceptin ( see 4.3 ) .
caution should be exercised for pneumonitis , especially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes .
5 following anthracycline ( doxorubicin or epirubicin ) containing chemotherapy .
a careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding to treat with Herceptin .
formal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular concerns following baseline screening .
cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment ( e. g. every three months ) .
monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac dysfunction .
for early breast cancer patients , cardiac assessment , as performed at baseline , should be repeated every 3 months during treatment and at 6 , 12 and 24 months following cessation of treatment .
patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent monitoring ( e. g. every 6-8 weeks ) .
if patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function , but remain asymptomatic , the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of Herceptin therapy has been seen .
caution should be exercised in treating patients with symptomatic heart failure , a history of hypertension or documented coronary artery disease , and in early breast cancer , in those patients with an LVEF of 55 or less .
if LVEF drops 10 ejection points from baseline AND to below 50 , Herceptin should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately 3 weeks .
if LVEF has not improved , or declined further , discontinuation of Herceptin should be strongly considered , unless the benefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks .
all such patients should be referred for assessment by a cardiologist and followed up .
if symptomatic cardiac failure develops during Herceptin therapy , it should be treated with the standard medications for this purpose .
discontinuation of Herceptin therapy should be strongly considered in patients who develop clinically significant heart failure unless the benefits for an individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks .
the safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in patients who experience cardiotoxicity has not been prospectively studied .
however , most patients who developed heart failure in the pivotal trials improved with standard medical treatment .
this included diuretics , cardiac glycosides , beta- blockers and / or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors .
the majority of patients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of Herceptin treatment continued on weekly therapy with Herceptin without additional clinical cardiac events .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
no interaction studies have been performed .
a risk for interactions with concomitant medication cannot be excluded .
pregnancy and lactation
6 Reproduction studies have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg / kg Herceptin and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus .
placental transfer of trastuzumab during the early ( Days 20 50 of gestation ) and late ( Days 120 150 of gestation ) foetal development period was observed .
it is not known whether Herceptin can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect reproductive capacity .
in the postmarketing setting , cases of oligohydramnios have been reported in pregnant women receiving Herceptin .
lactation A study conducted in lactating cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg / kg Herceptin demonstrated that trastuzumab is secreted in the milk .
the presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not associated with any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age .
it is not known whether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk .
as human IgG1 is secreted into human milk , and the potential for harm to the infant is unknown , women should not breast-feed during Herceptin therapy and for 6 months after the last dose of Herceptin .
effects on ability to drive and use machines
no studies on the effects on the ability to drive and to use machines have been performed .
patients experiencing infusion-related symptoms should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate .

12 Infusion-Related Symptoms During the first infusion of Herceptin chills and / or fever are observed commonly in patients .
other signs and / or symptoms may include nausea , hypertension , vomiting , pain , rigors , headache , cough , dizziness , rash , and asthenia .
these symptoms are usually mild to moderate in severity , and occur infrequently with subsequent Herceptin infusions .
these symptoms can be treated with an analgesic / antipyretic such as meperidine or paracetamol , or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine ( see 4.2 ) .
some adverse reactions to Herceptin infusion including dyspnoea , hypotension , wheezing , bronchospasm , supraventricular tachyarrythmia , reduced oxygen saturation and respiratory distress can be serious and potentially fatal ( see 4.4 ) .
allergic-like and hypersensitivity reactions Allergic reactions , anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock , urticaria and angioedema occurring during the first infusion of Herceptin , have been reported rarely .
over a third of these patients had a negative re- challenge and continued to receive Herceptin .
some of these reactions can be serious and potentially fatal ( see 4.4 ) .
the incidence of cardiac adverse events from retrospective analysis of data from the combination therapy study ( Herceptin plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone and the Herceptin monotherapy study is shown in the following table :

in the HERA trial , NYHA class III-IV heart failure was observed in 0.6 of patients in the one-year arm .
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic NYHA class I II events were observed in 3.0 of patients in the Herceptin arm compared to 0.5 of patients in the observation arm .
the percentage of patients with at least one significant LVEF drop ( decrease of 10 EF points and to &lt; 50 ) during the study was 7.4 in the 1 year Herceptin arm versus 2.3 in the observation arm .
haematological toxicity Haematological toxicity was infrequent following the administration of Herceptin as a single agent in the metastatic setting , WHO Grade 3 leucopenia , thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurring in &lt; 1 of patients .
no WHO Grade 4 toxicities were observed .
there was an increase in WHO Grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity in patients treated with the combination of Herceptin and paclitaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel alone ( 34 versus 21 ) .
haematological toxicity was also increased in patients receiving Herceptin and docetaxel , compared with docetaxel alone ( 32 grade 3 / 4 neutropenia versus 22 , using NCI-CTC criteria ) .
note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100mg / m2 is known to result in neutropenia in 97 of patients , 76 grade 4 , based on nadir blood counts .
the incidence of febrile neutropenia / neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with Herceptin plus docetaxel ( 23 versus 17 for patients treated with docetaxel alone ) .
using NCI-CTC criteria , in the HERA trial , 0.4 of Herceptin-treated patients experienced a shift of 3 or 4 grades from baseline , compared with 0.6 in the observation arm .
hepatic and renal toxicity WHO Grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity was observed in 12 of patients following administration of Herceptin as single agent , in the metastatic setting .
this toxicity was associated with progression of disease in the liver in 60 of these patients .
who Grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity was less frequently observed among patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel than among patients receiving paclitaxel ( 7 compared with 15 ) .
no WHO Grade 3 or 4 renal toxicity was observed in patients treated with Herceptin .
diarrhoea Of patients treated with Herceptin as a single agent in the metastatic setting , 27 experienced diarrhoea .
an increase in the incidence of diarrhoea , primarily mild to moderate in severity , has also been observed in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel alone .
in the HERA trial , 7 of Herceptin-treated patients had diarrhoea .
14 An increased incidence of infections , primarily mild upper respiratory infections of minor clinical significance or catheter infections , has been observed primarily in patients treated with Herceptin plus paclitaxel or docetaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel alone .
overdose
there is no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials .
single doses of Herceptin alone greater than 10 mg / kg have not been administered in the clinical trials .
doses up to this level were well tolerated .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
antineoplastic agents , ATC code :
trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) .
overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20 -30 of primary breast cancers .
studies indicate that patients whose tumours overexpress HER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not overexpress HER2 .
the extracellular domain of the receptor ( ECD , p105 ) can be shed into the blood stream and measured in serum samples .
trastuzumab has been shown , in both in vitro assays and in animals , to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2 .
additionally , trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) .
in vitro , trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2 .
detection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay .
HER2 overexpression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) -based assessment of fixed tumour blocks ( see 4.4 ) .
HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation ( FISH ) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation ( CISH ) of fixed tumour blocks .
patients are eligible for Herceptin treatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3 score by IHC or a positive FISH or CISH result .
to ensure accurate and reproducible results , the testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory , which can ensure validation of the testing procedures .
the recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as follows :
staining Intensity Score
staining pattern
HER2 Overexpression Assessment
no staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in &lt; 10 of the tumour cells
negative
a faint / barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in &gt; 10 of the tumour cells .
the cells are only stained in part of their membrane .
negative
a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is detected in &gt; 10 of the tumour cells .
weak to moderate overexpression
a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is detected in &gt; 10 of the tumour cells .
moderate to strong overexpression
in general , CISH is considered positive if there are more than 5 copies of the HER2 gene per nucleus in greater than 50 of tumour cells .
for full instructions on assay performance and interpretation please refer to the package inserts of validated FISH and CISH assays .
official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply .
for any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression , the analyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance of validated methods .
such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate overexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate ( congruent with 2 ) and strong ( congruent with 3 ) overexpression of HER2 .
clinical Data Herceptin has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have tumours that overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease ( Herceptin alone ) .
Herceptin has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease .
patients who had previously received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m2 infused over 3 hours ) with or without Herceptin .
in the pivotal trial of docetaxel ( 100 mg / m2 infused over 1 hour ) with or without Herceptin , 60 of the patients had received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy .
patients were treated with Herceptin until progression of disease .
the efficacy of Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior adjuvant anthracyclines has not been studied .
however , Herceptin plus docetaxel was efficacious in patients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines .
the test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal Herceptin monotherapy and Herceptin plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed immunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine monoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5 .
these tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin &apos;s fixative .
this investigative clinical trial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3 scale .
patients classified as staining 2 or 3 were included , while those staining 0 or 1 were excluded .
greater than 70 of patients enrolled exhibited 3 overexpression .
the data suggest that beneficial effects were greater among those patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 ( 3 ) .
the main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel , with or without Herceptin , was immunohistochemistry .
a minority of patients were tested using fluorescence in-situ hybridisation ( FISH ) .
in this trial , 87 of patients entered had disease that was IHC3 , and 95 of patients entered had disease that was IHC3 and / or FISH-positive .

combination treatment with Herceptin and anastrozole
Herceptin has been studied in combination with anastrozole for first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in HER2 overexpressing , hormone-receptor ( i. e. estrogen-receptor ( ER ) and / or progesterone- receptor ( PR ) ) positive postmenopausal patients .
progression free survival was doubled in the Herceptin plus anastrozole arm compared to anastrozole ( 4.8 months versus 2.4 months ) .
for time to response and duration of response no difference could be recorded between the arms .
the median overall survival was extended by 4.6 months for patients in the combination arm .
the difference was not statistically significant , however more than half of the patients in the anastrozole alone arm crossed over to a Herceptin containing regimen after progression of disease .

early breast cancer is defined as non-metastatic primary invasive carcinoma of the breast .
early breast cancer in the HERA trial was limited to operable , primary , invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast , with axillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumours at least 1 cm in diameter .
patients assigned to receive Herceptin were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg / kg , followed by 6 mg / kg every three weeks for one year .
the efficacy results from the Hera trial are summarized in the following table :
parameter Disease-free survival
Herceptin 1 Year N = 1693
p-value vs Observation
hazard Ratio vs Observation
- No. patients with event - No. patients without event Recurrence-free survival
- No. patients with event - No. patients without event Distant disease-free survival
- No. patients with event - No. patients without event
for the primary endpoint , DFS , the hazard ratio translates into an absolute benefit , in terms of a 2-year disease-free survival rate , of 7.6 percentage points ( 85.8 vs 78.2 ) in favour of the Herceptin arm .
immunogenicity Nine hundred and three patients treated with Herceptin , alone or in combination with chemotherapy , have been evaluated for antibody production .
human anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in one patient , who had no allergic manifestations .
19 Sites of progression After Herceptin and paclitaxel therapy for metastatic breast cancer in patients in the pivotal trial the following sites of disease progression were found :

patients may have had multiple sites of disease progression
the frequency of progression in the liver was significantly reduced in patients treated with the combination of Herceptin and paclitaxel .
more patients treated with Herceptin and paclitaxel progressed in the central nervous system than those treated with paclitaxel alone .
pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab have been studied in patients with metastatic breast cancer and early breast cancer .
short duration intravenous infusions of 10 , 50 , 100 , 250 , and 500 mg trastuzumab once weekly in patients demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics .
drug interaction studies have not been performed with Herceptin .
half-life The half-life is approximately 28.5 days ( 95 confidence interval , 25.5 32.8 days ) .
the washout period is up to 24 weeks ( 95 confidence interval , 18-24 weeks )
steady State Concentration Steady state pharmacokinetics should be reached by approximately 20 weeks ( 95 confidence interval , 18 24 weeks ) .
the concentrations were comparable to those reported previously in patients with metastatic breast cancer .
clearance Clearance decreased with increased dose level .
in clinical trials where a loading dose of 4 mg / kg trastuzumab followed by a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg / kg was used , the mean clearance was 0.225L / day .
the effects of patient characteristics ( such as age or serum creatinine ) on the disposition of trastuzumab have been evaluated .
the data suggest that the disposition of trastuzumab is not altered in
volume of Distribution In all clinical studies , volume of distribution approximated serum volume , 2.95 L.
circulating Shed Antigen Detectable concentrations of the circulating extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor ( shed antigen ) are found in the serum of some patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancers .
determination of shed antigen in baseline serum samples revealed that 64 ( 286 / 447 ) of patients had detectable shed antigen , which ranged as high as 1880 ng / ml ( median = 11 ng / ml ) .
patients with higher baseline shed antigen levels were more likely to have lower serum trough concentrations of trastuzumab .
however , with weekly dosing , most patients with elevated shed antigen levels achieved target serum concentrations of trastuzumab by week 6 and no significant relationship has been observed between baseline shed antigen and clinical response .
preclinical safety data
Herceptin is not genotoxic .
a study of trehalose , a major formulation excipient did not reveal any toxicities .
no long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of Herceptin , or to determine its effects on fertility in males .

nature and contents of container
Herceptin vial :
one 15 ml clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film .
each carton contains one vial .
special Precautions for disposal
preparation for Administration Appropriate aseptic technique should be used .
each vial of Herceptin is reconstituted with 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections ( not supplied ) .
use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided .
this yields a 7.4 ml solution for single-dose use , containing approximately 21 mg / ml trastuzumab , at a pH of approximately 6.0 .
a volume overage of 4 ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial .
Herceptin should be carefully handled during reconstitution .
causing excessive foaming during reconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Herceptin may result in problems with the amount of Herceptin that can be withdrawn from the vial .
instructions for Reconstitution :
1 ) Using a sterile syringe , slowly inject 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Herceptin , directing the stream into the lyophilised cake .
2 ) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution .
do NOT SHAKE !
slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual .
allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes .
the reconstituted Herceptin results in a colourless to pale yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates .
determine the volume of the solution required : based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab / kg body weight , or a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg trastuzumab / kg body weight :
volume ( ml ) = Body weight ( kg ) x dose ( 8 mg / kg for loading or 6 mg / kg for maintenance ) 21 ( mg / ml , concentration of reconstituted solution )
the appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to an infusion bag containing 250 ml of 0.9 sodium chloride solution .
do not use with glucose-containing solutions ( see 6.2 ) .
the bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming .
parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to administration .
once the infusion is prepared it should be administered immediately .
if diluted aseptically , it may be stored for 24 hours ( do not store above 30 C ) .
22 No incompatibilities between Herceptin and polyvinylchloride , polyethylene or polypropylene bags have been observed .

further information
what HERCEPTIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
each pack of Herceptin contains one vial .
this vial contains a white to pale yellow lyophilised ( &quot; freeze-dried &quot; ) powder for concentrate for solution for infusion .
the lyophilised powder must be reconstituted and diluted before use .
Herceptin contains the active substance trastuzumab , which is a humanised monoclonal antibody .
this is similar to the antibodies produced naturally by the body which protect it against infections with viruses and bacteria .
monoclonal antibodies are proteins which specifically recognise and bind to other unique proteins in the body called antigens .
trastuzumab binds selectively to an antigen called human epidermal growth factor 2 ( HER2 ) .
HER2 is found in large amounts on the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth .
when Herceptin binds to HER2 it stops the growth of such cells .
it is used alone in conditions where other treatments proved unsuccessful .
it is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agents paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer .
it is also used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer .
if you receive Herceptin with paclitaxel , docetaxel or an aromatase inhibitor you should also read the package inserts for these products .
before YOU USE HERCEPTIN
do not use Herceptin
- If you are allergic to trastuzumab , to murine ( mouse ) proteins , or to any of the other ingredients .
- If you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen
treatment .
32 Take special care with Herceptin
this is because
Herceptin can cause heart failure .
- If you have ever had chemotherapy with a drug called doxorubicin or a drug related to
these drugs can damage heart muscle and increase the risk of heart problems with Herceptin .
Herceptin can cause breathing difficulties , especially when it is first given .
this could be more serious if you are already breathless .
apart from breathing difficulties , Herceptin can cause fever , chills , flu-like symptoms , swelling of the face and lips , rash , wheezing , heart rhythm disturbances and blood pressure changes .
these effects mainly occur with the first infusion and during the first few hours after the start of the infusion .
occasionally , symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins .
sometimes , symptoms may improve and then get worse later .
if either of these happens to you , contact your doctor immediately .
you will therefore be observed by a health care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the start of other infusions .
if you develop a reaction , they will slow down or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects .
very rarely , patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment have died when they are given Herceptin .
your doctor will closely supervise your therapy with Herceptin .
treatment with Herceptin may affect the heart .
therefore , your heart function will be checked before and during the treatment with Herceptin .
if you develop any signs of heart failure ( i. e . , inadequate pumping of blood by the heart ) , you may have to stop Herceptin .
it may take up to 6 months for Herceptin to be removed from the body .
therefore , you should tell your doctor or pharmacist that you have had Herceptin if you start any new medication in the 6 months after stopping treatment .
please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
please tell your doctor or pharmacist that you have had Herceptin if you start any medication in the 6 months after stopping treatment with Herceptin .
use in children and adolescents At present , Herceptin is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years because there is not enough information in this age group .
pregnancy and breast-feeding Before starting treatment , you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant , if you think you are pregnant or if you intend to become pregnant .
in rare cases , a reduction in the amount of ( amniotic ) fluid that surrounds the developing foetus within the amniotic sac has been observed in pregnant women receiving Herceptin .
your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Herceptin during pregnancy .
do not breast-feed your baby during Herceptin therapy and for 6 months after the last dose of Herceptin .
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine
driving and using machines
33 We do not know whether Herceptin could affect your ability to drive a car or operate machinery .
however , if you experience symptoms , such as chills or fever , during an infusion of Herceptin ( see 4 . ) , you should not drive or use machines until these symptoms disappear .
how TO USE HERCEPTIN
dosage and frequency of administration Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you .
the dose of Herceptin depends on your body weight .
the number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment .
your doctor will discuss this with you .
for early breast cancer , Herceptin is given every 3 weeks .
the intravenous infusion ( &quot; drip &quot; ) will be given over approximately 90 minutes .
it is given as an intravenous infusion ( &quot; drip &quot; ) by a health care professional .
the first dose is given over 90 minutes .
the subsequent doses may be given over 30 minutes .
you will also be observed for some time at the end of each infusion ( see 2. under &quot; Take special care with Herceptin &quot; ) .
alternatively for metastatic breast cancer , Herceptin can also be given every 3 weeks .
the intravenous infusion ( &quot; drip &quot; ) will be given over approximately 90 minutes .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Herceptin can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
some of these side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation .
during a Herceptin infusion , chills , fever and other flu like symptoms may occur .
these are very common ( more than 10 out of 100 patients ) .
they mainly occur with the first infusion and are temporary .
these symptoms can be serious and some patients have died ( see 2. under &quot; Take special care with Herceptin &quot; ) .
you will be observed by a health professional during and after each infusion .
if you develop a reaction , they will slow down or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects .
the infusion may be continued after the symptoms improve .
other side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Herceptin , not just related to an infusion .
heart problems can sometimes occur and can be serious .
they include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to heart failure , inflammation of the lining around the heart ( pericarditis ) , and heart rhythm disturbances .
other very common side effects of Herceptin , occurring in more than 10 out of 100 patients , are : diarrhoea , weakness , skin rashes , chest pain , abdominal pain , joint pain , and muscle pain .
some of the side effects you experience may be due to your underlying breast cancer .
if you receive Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy , some of them may also be due to the chemotherapy .
if you experience any of the side effects mentioned in this leaflet or notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet , please inform your doctor or pharmacist .

this leaflet was last approved in
the following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only
always keep this medicine in the closed original pack at a temperature of 2 - 8 C in a refrigerator .
a vial of Herceptin reconstituted with sterile water for injections ( not supplied ) is stable for 48 hours at 2
- 8 C after reconstitution and must not be frozen .
each vial of Herceptin is reconstituted with 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections ( not supplied ) .
use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided .
this yields a 7.4 ml solution for single-dose use , containing approximately 21 mg / ml trastuzumab .
a volume overage of 4 ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial .
Herceptin should be carefully handled during reconstitution .
causing excessive foaming during reconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Herceptin may result in problems with the amount of Herceptin that can be withdrawn from the vial .
instructions for Reconstitution :
1 ) Using a sterile syringe , slowly inject 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Herceptin , directing the stream into the lyophilised cake .
2 ) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution .
do NOT SHAKE !
slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual .
allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes .
the reconstituted Herceptin results in a colourless to pale yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates .
determine the volume of the solution required : based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab / kg body weight , or a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg trastuzumab / kg body weight :
volume ( ml ) = Body weight ( kg ) x dose ( 4 mg / kg for loading or 2 mg / kg for maintenance ) 21 ( mg / ml , concentration of reconstituted solution )
based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab / kg body weight , or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of 6 mg trastuzumab / kg body weight :
volume ( ml ) = Body weight ( kg ) x dose ( 8 mg / kg for loading or 6 mg / kg for maintenance ) 21 ( mg / ml , concentration of reconstituted solution )
the appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to a polyvinylchloride , polyethylene or polypropylene infusion bag containing 250 ml of 0.9 sodium chloride solution .
do not use with glucose-containing solutions .
the bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming .
parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to administration .
once the infusion is prepared it should be
if diluted aseptically , it may be stored for 24 hours ( do not store above 30 C ) .

clinical PARTICULARS
therapeutic indications
this combined vaccine is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , hepatitis B caused by all known subtypes of viruses , poliomyelitis and invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b .
posology and method of administration
primary vaccination :
the primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses of 0.5 ml administered within the first year of life according to official recommendations .
there should be an interval of at least 1 month between doses : such as 2 , 3 , 4 months ; 2 , 4 , 6 months ; 3 , 5 months .
2 Booster :
Hexavac can be used for the booster dose provided the toddler has received a full primary vaccination course of each of the antigens contained in HEXAVAC regardless of whether they were administered as monovalent or combination vaccines produced by Sanofi Pasteur MSD .
method of administration HEXAVAC should be administered intramuscularly into the quadriceps or deltoid preferably at alternating sites for subsequent injections .
this vaccine should not be used in newborns , adolescents or adults .
Contraindications
known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or severe reaction after previous administration of the vaccine .
encephalopathy within 7 days of administration of a previous dose of any vaccine containing pertussis antigens ( whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines ) .
in these circumstances the vaccination course should be continued with vaccine not containing a pertussis component .
vaccination should be postponed in the case of fever or acute disease .
special warnings and special precautions for use
this vaccine should not be used in newborns , adolescents or adults .
infants born of hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBsAg ) -positive mothers should receive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin ( HBIG ) and Hepatitis B Vaccine ( Recombinant ) at birth and should complete the hepatitis B vaccination series .
the subsequent administration of HEXAVAC for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of HBsAg-positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has not been studied .
Hexavac should not be used as the birth dose or subsequent doses during the first year of life for children born to HbsAg- positive mothers .
Hexavac should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects .
Hexavac should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly .
the intradermal or subcutaneous routes must not be used either .
if any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of the vaccine , the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines should be carefully considered :
temperature of 40.0 C within 48 hours , not due to another identifiable cause .
collapse or shock-like state ( hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness episode ) within 48 hours of vaccination .
persistent , inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours , occurring within 48 hours of vaccination .
convulsions with or without fever , occurring within 3 days of vaccination .
antipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local guidelines .
3 As with all injectable vaccines , appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be readily available for immediate use in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of vaccine .
in subjects who have a history of a severe reaction within 48 hours of a previous injection with a vaccine containing similar components , the course of vaccination should be carefully considered .
because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B , it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B infection to be present at the time of immunisation .
the vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases .
Hexavac will not prevent hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A , hepatitis C and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens .
Hexavac does not protect against invasive diseases due to serotypes other than Haemophilus influenzae type b or against meningitis of other origins .
as each dose may contain undetectable traces of neomycin , streptomycin and polymyxin B , caution should be exercised when the vaccine is administered to subjects with hypersensitivity to these antibiotics .
there are currently no sufficient data available regarding immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR ( pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine , adsorbed ) .
however when HEXAVAC was co-administered with PREVENAR ( pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine , adsorbed ) in clinical studies , the rate of febrile reactions was higher compared to that occurring following the administration of hexavalent vaccines alone .
these reactions were mostly moderate ( less than or equal to 39 C ) and transient .
Hexavac must not be mixed in the same syringe with other vaccines or other parenterally administered drugs .
interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
except in the case of immunosuppressive therapy ( see 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use ) , no significant clinical interaction with other treatments or biological products has been documented .
there are no data in regards to the efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with Measles , Mumps and Rubella Virus Vaccine , live .
there are currently no sufficient data available regarding immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR ( pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine , adsorbed ) .

undesirable effects
clinical trials experience
in clinical trials , more than 3,900 infants and 4,400 toddlers ( from 12 to 20 months of age ) have received HEXAVAC .
commonly reported reactions included redness and / or induration / swelling / pain at the injection site , fever equal to or greater than 38 C , irritability , drowsiness , loss of appetite , insomnia , diarrhoea and vomiting .
febrile convulsion and high-pitched crying have been reported rarely .
a single bilateral oedematous reaction of the lower limbs and a single , hypotonic hypo- responsive episode have been reported .
these signs and symptoms usually occurred within 48 hours following the vaccination .
they were mostly mild , generally lasting for up to 72 hours and resolved spontaneously .
no increase in the number of undesirable reactions was noted between first , second and third doses of the primary series except for an increase in the rate of fever equal to or greater than 38 C after the second dose in the primary series .
the rate of fever equal to or greater than 40 C increased after booster immunisation but remained &lt; 1 .
redness and / or induration &gt; 7 cm at the injection site increased after booster immunisation but remained &lt; 1 .
in rare instances , these cases were associated with swelling of the entire limb .
post marketing experience The following additional undesirable effects have been reported following the widespread use of HEXAVAC .
common ( &gt; 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) Application site disorders ( reactions at the injection site ) :
oedema / Pruritus / Urticaria .
rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) Body as a whole - General disorders :

potential undesirable effects In addition , other undesirable effects have been reported with the marketed use of vaccines closely related to HEXAVAC .
undesirable effects reported in clinical trials and the marketed use to date of Sanofi Pasteur MSD diphtheria , tetanus , acellular pertussis , Haemophilus influenzae type b and inactivated poliomyelitis adsorbed vaccine are included in the list of undesirable effects for HEXAVAC .
very rare reactions following the use of Sanofi Pasteur MSD hepatitis B ( recombinant ) vaccine include alopecia , hypotension , optic neuritis , facial paralysis , erythema multiforme , and anaphylaxis .
as with other hepatitis B vaccines , in many instances , the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established .
overdose

pharmacological PROPERTIES
pharmacodynamic properties
the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are prepared from the toxins of cultures of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani by formaldehyde detoxification followed by purification .
the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus is produced by culture of a recombinant strain of yeast cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
the poliomyelitis vaccine is obtained from the propagation of poliomyelitis viruses types 1 , 2 and 3 on Vero cells , purified , then inactivated by formaldehyde .
the acellular pertussis components ( pertussis toxin :
PT and filamentous haemagglutinin :
FHA ) are extracted from Bordetella pertussis cultures then separately purified .
the pertussis toxin ( PT ) is detoxified separately with glutaraldehyde to create the toxoid ( PTxd ) .
the FHA is not detoxified .
it has been shown that PTxd and FHA play a major role in protection against pertussis .
this vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide ( polyribosyl ribitol phosphate :
PRP ) of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugated to tetanus toxoid .
when administered alone PRP induces a serological response , but it is weakly immunogenic in infants .
the covalent binding of PRP to tetanus toxoid makes it a T-cell dependent antigen which induces a specific IgG anti-PRP response in infants and which elicits immune memory .
this vaccine induces specific humoral antibodies against HBsAg ( anti-HBs ) and against diphtheria and tetanus toxoids ( anti-D and anti-T ) .
immune response after primary vaccination In the pivotal clinical study , all infants ( 100 ) developed a seroprotective antibody level ( equal to or greater than 0.01 IU / ml ) to both diphtheria and tetanus antigens one month after completion of the primary series .
for pertussis , 91.8 and 90.5 of infants achieved a four-fold rise in PT and FHA antibody titres respectively .
protective levels of anti-HBs ( equal to or greater than 10 mIU / ml ) were achieved in
6 96.6 of infants ; the geometric mean titres ( GMTs ) were diminished compared to the control group .
Anti-poliovirus titres above the threshold of 5 ( reciprocal of dilution in seroneutralisation ) against poliovirus types 1 , 2 and 3 were developed in 100 of infants and these were considered protected against poliomyelitis .
after primary vaccination , 93.7 of infants had an anti-PRP titre equal to or greater than 0.15 g / ml ; the GMTs were diminished compared to the control group ( 2.06 g / ml versus 3.69 g / ml ) .
a mean 7.4 and 4.3-fold rise in antibody titres to PT and FHA respectively was achieved and all toddlers developed protective antibody titres against poliovirus types 1 , 2 and 3 .
just before the booster injection anti-PRP GMTs were 0.40 g / ml and 0.64 g / ml for HEXAVAC and for the control group respectively .
after booster , GMTs increased to 16.7 g / ml and 23.0 g / ml in each group respectively , indicating a strong anamnestic response .
anti- PRP titres equal to or greater than 0.15 g / ml and equal to or greater than 1 g / ml were achieved in 100 and 96.6 of toddlers respectively .
following the booster dose , 96.6 of toddlers developed anti-HBs titres equal to or greater than 10 mIU / ml .
a mean 20.5-fold rise in antibody titres to HBs was observed after the booster dose .
other trials gave similar or higher results .
surveillance and antibody long term persistence studies are ongoing and will provide additional information in regards to the duration of protection .
after a 3 , 5 , 12 months schedule , immune responses were compatible with the sought clinical protection and of the same magnitude as those reported previously for HEXAVAC or other licensed combination vaccines during the second year of life

what IS HEXAVAC AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Hexavac is an injectable vaccine in a 0.5 ml single dose syringe .
39 HEXAVAC is available in packs of 1 , 10 , 25 and 50 with or without neddles .
before YOU USE HEXAVAC
do not use HEXAVAC :
- if your child is allergic to any component of the vaccine .
- in case of newborns , adolescents or adults .
- if your child has fever or other illness , particularly a cough , cold or flu ( vaccination should be
delayed ) .
- if your infant has suffered brain damage ( encephalopathy ) following a previous dose of a whole
cell or acellular pertussis vaccine .
take special care with HEXAVAC :
- if your child has an hypersensitivity to neomycin , streptomycin and polymyxin B , due to the use
of these substances during production .
- if your child has a thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following
an intramuscular administration to these subjects .
- if any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of the
vaccine ( The decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccines to your child should be carefully considered if any of the following events are known to have occurred following the administration of the vaccine ) :
temperature of 40.0 C within 48 hours , not due to another identifiable cause .
persistent , inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours , occurring within 48 hours of vaccination .
convulsions with or without fever , occurring within 3 days of vaccination .
- if your child has any present or past medical problems or allergies , including allergic reactions
after any dose of HEXAVAC .
- if you are a hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBsAg ) -positive mother , your infant should
receive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin ( HBIG ) and hepatitis B vaccine ( Recombinant ) at birth and should complete the hepatitis B vaccination series .
the subsequent administration of HEXAVAC for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of HBsAg-positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has not been studied .
Hexavac should not be used as the birth dose or subsequent doses during the first year of life for children born to HbsAg-positive mothers .
- because as with other similar vaccines , cases of Haemophilus b disease may occur in the week
after vaccination prior to the onset of the protective effects of the vaccine .
- because hepatitis B infection can go undetected for a long period of time , it is possible that an
individual may already be infected at the time the vaccine is given .
the vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B in these individuals .
using other vaccines There are currently not sufficient data available regarding immune response of the concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR ( pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine , adsorbed ) .
however , when HEXAVAC was co-administered in clinical studies the rate of febrile reactions was higher compared to that occurring following administration of hexavalent vaccines alone .
these reactions were mostly moderate and transient .
if your child is due to be vaccinated with HEXAVAC and other vaccines simultaneously , please ask your doctor for further information .
how TO USE HEXAVAC
the primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses of 0.5 ml administered within the first year of life according to the official recommendations .
there should be an interval of at least 1 month between doses : such as 2 , 3 , 4 months ; 2 , 4 , 6 months ; 3 , 5 months .
Hexavac can be used for the booster dose provided the toddler has received a full primary vaccination course of each of the antigens contained in Hexavac regardless of whether they were administered as monovalent or combination vaccines produced by Sanofi Pasteur MSD .
Hexavac should be injected into the quadriceps or deltoid muscle preferably at alternating sites for subsequent injections .
Hexavac should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly .
the intradermal or subcutaneous routes must not be used either .
Hexavac must not be mixed in the same syringe with other vaccines or other parenterally administered drugs .
for needle free syringes , the needle should be pushed firmly on to the end of the prefilled syringe and rotated through 90 degrees .
if you forget to take HEXAVAC :
your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
as with other vaccines your child may have some side effects .
Hexavac has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials .
side effects included injection-site reactions such as tenderness , redness , swelling and pain .
other side effects included irritability , sleepiness , fever , sleeplessness , diarrhoea , vomiting , loss of appetite and prolonged crying where the child cannot be consoled .
following the widespread use of HEXAVAC , additional undesirable effects have been reported :
among reactions found at the injection site , itching and hives have been also reported .
rarely , the patient may have prolonged or abnormal crying .
tell your doctor promptly about these symptoms .
if the condition persists or worsens , you may have to bring your child to the doctor .
in addition , tell your doctor if your child experiences any symptoms that suggest an allergic reaction such as rash , redness , itching , pallor or oedema after any dose in the vaccination series .
if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet , please inform your doctor or pharmacist .
storing HEXAVAC
keep out of the reach and sight of children .
store at 2 C 8 C ( in a refrigerator ) Do not freeze Do not use after the expiry date stated on the label .

scientific CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR AMENDMENT OF THE SUMMARIES OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS AND PACKAGE LEAFLETS PRESENTED BY THE EMEA
- Vaccination offers benefits to the individual child and to the general population .
the CHMP
considered that the benefits of vaccination far outweighed possible risks of existing vaccines , including hexavalent vaccines , and that vaccination should be continued according to national vaccination schedules .
- The causes of death remain unexplained and on the basis of the available data , it is not possible to
establish a cause and effect association with the hexavalent vaccines .
- The temporal relationship identified between 4 Sudden Unexpected Death ( SUD ) cases and
hexavalent vaccination raises a possible signal for Hexavac vaccination and SUD , but there are some inevitable limitations of the data sources and methods used to calculate the expected numbers .
in any case , the signal only raised a suspicion and did not prove a cause and effect relationship .
further studies are needed to establish whether or not there is a risk .
the CHMP was requested to give an opinion as to whether the Marketing Authorisation ( MA ) for Hexavac should be maintained , varied , suspended or withdrawn .
the risk assessment focused on epidemiological analyses of the cases of SUD , autopsy reports of the individual cases , all available data from the previous review and the results from the observed / expected analysis of Prof.
von Kries , as published in the European Journal of Paediatrics , 2005 ( Eur J Pediatr 2005 Feb ; 164 ( 2 ) : 61-69 , Epub 2004 Dec 16 ) .
safety Issue
the CHMP had previously concluded that there is a statistical signal of an excess occurrence of cases of SUD within 24 hours of a booster vaccination with Hexavac during the 2nd year of life .
the signal had been identified in the observed / expected analysis ( see above ) .
the investigators regarded their data as evidence for &quot; a strong risk signal for Hexavac booster vaccinations in the 2nd year of life and SUD &quot; .
the absolute risk ( reporting rate ) would correspond to 1 death due to SUD in 300,000- 400,000 children in the 2nd year of life .
on the basis of extensive analyses showing a remaining excess risk , i. e. sensitivity analyses , it was concluded that the findings were unlikely to be attributed solely to limitations of the data sources .
the CHMP concluded , that the absolute risk was considered to be very small .
in addition , the observed / expected analysis could not provide evidence for a cause and effect relationship between SUDs and vaccination with Hexavac .
additionally , there is no biologic explanation so far to support a causal link .
neither is there any hypothetical explanation regarding possible effects on the immune or autonomous nervous systems , on pro- convulsive mechanisms or by means of quality defects in the production of the multivalent vaccines .
the updated review of the individual cases did not identify any new safety issue for Hexavac .
additionally , no specific underlying mechanism could be identified to explain a causal link between Hexavac and an increased occurrence of SUD .
different experts had previously assessed and discussed the quality aspects of Hexavac and no mechanistic support for an increased risk of SUD was identified .
there is no inconsistency between batches and no quality deficiencies were identified .
based on the available data , there is no possible link between an immunological reaction caused by the hexavalent vaccines and an increase of SUD occurrence .
animal studies and animal models were thoroughly reviewed to analyse a possible relationship between SUD and Hexavac .
however , there was currently no animal model available to investigate SUDs .
furthermore the EEG monitoring did not show proconvulsive effects related to the administration of vaccines .
in summary , it was found that no new relevant data has become available since previous discussions / conclusions by / of the CHMP .
the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAHs in relation to the signal of SUD in children and toddlers .
the CHMP concluded that a signal does exist based on a statistical relationship , which may represent an artefact in the data , a random cluster of events , or a true biological effect .
2 The CHMP concluded that serious adverse events , particularly cases of SUD , shall be continuously and carefully monitored and assessed .
therefore the CHMP members recommended follow-up measures to further investigate the known cases and to initiate further studies
on the basis of the current data , the CHMP concluded that the safety profile of Hexavac is in line with the current SPC .
grounds FOR MAINTAINING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF HEXAVAC
whereas
the CHMP came to the conclusion that after the review of available data , the causes of death remain unexplained and it is not possible to establish a causal association with Hexavac .
the CHMP members have , in line with the previous reviews , come to the conclusion that the signal does exist based on a statistical relationship , which may represent an artefact in the data , a random cluster of events , or a true biological effect .
however , the strength of this signal is , in the absence of a convincing biological and causal link , weak .
the CHMP concluded that no scientific rationale or convincing ethical considerations to take regulatory action have been presented .
therefore the benefit-risk balance for Hexavac remains positive and no further regulatory action is necessary at this point in time .
the CHMP concluded that serious adverse events , particularly cases of SUD , shall be continuously and carefully monitored and assessed .
therefore the CHMP members recommended follow-up measures to further investigate the known cases and to initiate further studies
scientific CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF HEXAVAC PRESENTED BY THE EMEA
Hexavac is a hexavalent vaccine which contains combined antigens derived from Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetani , Bordetella pertussis , Hepatitis B virus , polio virus and Haemophilus influenzae type b .
this combined vaccine is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of children against the viruses and bacteria mentioned above .
on 26 May 2005 , the CHMP agreed on the need to convene an Ad Hoc Expert Group Meeting on Hepatitis short and long-term protection afforded by recombinant Hepatitis B vaccines .
the CHMP expressed concerns that there is evidence of unpredictable variability in Hepatitis B antibody response following vaccination with Hexavac .
this variability seems to be related to currently uncontrollable variances in the manufacturing process of the recombinant HepB vaccine component .
concerns were expressed on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac and the potential consequences on long-term protection against Hepatitis B infection and boostability post primary course of vaccination with this vaccine .
between July and September 2005 , the marketing authorisation holder gave oral explanations to the CHMP and its working parties on the low immunogenicity of the HepB component in long-term protection against Hepatitis B afforded by Hexavac .
the concerns over the immunogenicity of the HepB component increased when lower than expected seroconversion rates were observed following the concomitant administration of Hexavac with other meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines .
these observations led to an intensive investigation programme agreed by the MAH to identify the reason for the lower immune response .
unpredictable variances to the immunogenicity of the HepB component were investigated by the MAH .
the MAH proposed the development of strategies to identify the source of the problem , as well as to produce a more immunogenic formulation .
critical steps of the manufacturing process have been investigated by the marketing authorisation holder ( MAH ) , and a modified process step was identified as the most likely strategy to enhance immunogenicity of the HepB component .
these findings were based on a rather limited
on the other hand , there are currently no reports on Hepatitis B breakthrough cases after Hexavac vaccination , considering that the EU is a low endemic region and individual risks would potentially increase only later in life .
the MAH reiterated their commitment to establish a test to discriminate batches of Hexavac which have elucidated a good vs. an insufficient immune response during clinical trials .
furthermore , the MAH has proposed to change the Product Information ( PI ) , namely separate administration of pneumococcal and meningococcal conjugate vaccines .
continuous efforts are being made to improve the immunogenicity of the HepB component of Hexavac .
the MAH proposed also to perform additional studies and further develop the Hepatitis B surveillance programme .
Notwithstanding the MAH proposals , the CHMP considered that the applicability of the MAH proposals need to be substantiated by data , which validity needs to be determined .
furthermore , the proposed amendments to the PI wording were insufficient to adequately address negative consequences on HepB efficacy resulting from variances in the manufacturing process .
overall , the CHMP considered the multifactorial nature of the low immunogenicity of the HepB component in Hexavac .
reference was made to the highly variable quality of the HepB component contained in Hexavac emerging from a manufacturing production in which the root cause of the low immunogenicity has failed to be identified .
these facts were put into perspective with the clinical consequences observed so far and the apparent low benefits and uncertainties obtained from the Hepatitis B vaccination utilising Hexavac for the target population .
the CHMP identified that the decreased immunogeniticy of the HepB component released by the MAH seems to be due to variability in the production process for this component .
the CHMP considered that clinical alternatives exist , i. e. hexavalent vaccines or equivalent combinations of vaccines containing the same components as Hexavac .
2 GROUNDS FOR SUSPENSION OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION OF HEXAVAC
whereas
the CHMP is of the Opinion that Hexavac , can no longer be maintained in normal clinical usage for the following reasons :
the CHMP identified that the decreased immunogeniticy of the HepB component released by the MAH seems to be due to variability in the production process for this component .
the CHMP has recommended the suspension of the Marketing Authorisations for Hexavac .

what is Humalog ?
Humalog is a range of solutions and suspensions for injection .
Humalog is supplied in vials , cartridges or in prefilled pens ( Humalog Pen , Humaject ) .
Humalog contains the active ingredient insulin lispro .
the Humalog range comprises fast-acting insulin solutions ( Humalog ) , longer-acting insulin suspensions ( Humalog NPL ) , and combination of both in various proportions ( Humalog Mix ) :
Humalog : insulin lispro solution Humalog NPL : insulin lispro protamine suspension Humalog Mix25 :
insulin lispro solution and 75 insulin lispro protamine suspension Humalog Mix50 :
insulin lispro solution and 50 insulin lispro protamine suspension
what is Humalog used for ?
Humalog is used to treat adults and children who have diabetes and need insulin to keep their blood sugar level controlled , including those patients whose diabetes has just been diagnosed .
the medicine is only available with a prescription .
how is Humalog used ?
Humalog , Humalog NPL and Humalog Mix may be given subcutaneously ( under the skin ) by injection into the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen ( tummy ) .
Humalog may also be given by continuous infusion using an insulin pump or intravenously ( into a vein ) .
Humalog and Humalog Mix products are normally given shortly before a meal and may be given soon after a meal if necessary .
Humalog can be used with a longer-acting insulin or oral diabetic medicines ( sulphonylureas ) .
Humalog NPL can be mixed with or given in conjunction with Humalog .
how does Humalog work ?
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar .
Humalog is a replacement insulin which very similar to the insulin made by the pancreas .
the active ingredient of Humalog , insulin lispro , is produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology .
it is made by a bacterium that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce insulin lispro .
insulin lispro products are available in various forms : as Humalog in the soluble form , which acts 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
Humalog Mix is a mixture between these both formulations .
the replacement insulin acts in same way as naturally produced insulin and helps glucose enter cells from the blood .
by controlling the level of blood sugar , the symptoms and complications of diabetes are reduced .
how has Humalog been studied ?
Humalog was originally studied in eight clinical trials including 2951 diabetic patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes .
the effectiveness of Humalog was compared to Humulin R ( a soluble recombinant DNA human insulin ) , when added to one or two daily doses of long-acting insulins .
the studies measured the level of glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled , and fasting glucose levels .
further studies were also done looking at the use of Humalog in 542 children and adolescents ( aged 2 to 19 ) , and the use of Humalog in combination with sulphonylureas ( oral anti-diabetes medicines ) .
what benefit has Humalog shown during the studies ?
there were no statistical differences between Humalog and Humulin on diabetic control measured by glycosylated haemoglobin or fasting glucose levels .
what is the risk associated with Humalog ?
Humalog may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) .
for the full description of the side effects reported with Humalog , please see the Package Leaflet .
Humalog should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive to any of the ingredients .
Humalog doses might also need to be adjusted when given with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on blood sugar ( the full list is available in the Package Leaflet ) .
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix or Humalog NPL be given intravenously .
why has Humalog been approved ?
the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Humalog &apos;s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of diabetes mellitus .
they recommended that Humalog be given marketing authorisation .
other information about Humalog :
the European Commission granted marketing authorisations valid throughout the European Union , for Humalog to Eli Lilly Netherland B. V. on 30 April 1996 .
this was renewed on 30 April 2001 .

summary OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
name OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Humalog 100 U / ml , solution for injection in vial
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
one ml contains 100U ( equivalent to 3.5mg ) insulin lispro ( recombinant DNA origin produced in E. coli ) .
each container includes 10ml equivalent to 1000U insulin lispro .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
solution for injection .
Humalog is a sterile , clear , colourless , aqueous solution .
clinical PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
for the treatment of adults and children with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis .
Humalog is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
the dosage should be determined by the physician , according to the requirement of the patient .
Humalog may be given shortly before meals .
when necessary Humalog can be given soon after meals .
Humalog preparations should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous infusion pump ( see section 4.2 ) and may , although not recommended , also be given by intramuscular injection .
if necessary , Humalog may also be administered intravenously , for example ; for the control of blood glucose levels during ketoacidosis , acute illnesses or during intra and post operative periods .
subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen .
use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a month .
when administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered .
after injection , the site of injection should not be massaged .
patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques .
Humalog takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity ( 2 to 5 hours ) given subcutaneously as compared with regular insulin .
this rapid onset of activity allows a Humalog injection ( or , in the case of administration by continuous subcutaneous infusion , a Humalog bolus ) to be given very close to mealtime .
the time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual .
the faster onset of action compared to soluble human insulin is maintained regardless of injection site .
as with all insulin preparations , the duration of action of Humalog is dependent on dose , site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
Humalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting human insulin or oral sulphonylurea agents , on the advice of a physician .
2 Use of Humalog in an insulin infusion pump :
only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro .
before infusing insulin lispro , the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability or otherwise for the particular pump .
read and follow the instructions that accompany the infusion pump .
use the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump .
change the infusion set every 48 hours .
use aseptic technique when inserting the infusion set .
in the event of a hypoglycaemic episode , the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved .
if repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur , notify your health care professional and consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion .
a pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels .
if an interruption to insulin flow is suspected , follow the instructions in the product literature and if appropriate , notify your health care professional .
when used with an insulin infusion pump , Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin .
intravenous administration of insulin :
intravenous injection of insulin lispro should be carried out following normal clinical practise for intravenous injections , for example by an intravenous bolus or by an infusion system .
frequent monitoring of the blood glucose levels is required .
infusion systems at concentrations from 0.1U / ml to 1.0U / ml insulin lispro in 0.9 sodium chloride or 5 dextrose are stable at room temperature for 48 hours .
it is recommended that the system is primed before starting the infusion to the patient .
4.3 Contraindications
hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any of the excipients .
hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
for fast-acting insulins , any patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across the whole day , particularly nocturnal / fasting glucose control .
the shorter-acting Humalog should be drawn into the syringe first , to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting insulin .
mixing of the insulins ahead of time or just before the injection should be on advice of the physician .
however , a consistent routine must be followed .
conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes , intensified insulin therapy , diabetic nerve disease or medications such as beta-blockers .
a few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness , coma , or death .
the use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment , especially in insulin- dependent diabetics , may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis ; conditions which are potentially lethal .
insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment .
insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances .
adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet .
exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia .
a consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if hypoglycaemia occurs , it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human insulin .
Humalog should only be used in children in preference to soluble insulin when a fast action of insulin might be beneficial .
for example , in the timing of the injections in relation to meals .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
insulin requirements may be increased by medicinal products with hyperglycaemic activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy , danazol , beta2 stimulants ( such as ritodrine , salbutamol , terbutaline ) .
the physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
it is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated ( insulin-dependent or gestational diabetes ) patient throughout pregnancy .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet or both .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
the patient &apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
this may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving , this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer .
4 specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented , since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors e. g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise .
local allergy in patients is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
redness , swelling , and itching can occur at the site of insulin injection .
this condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks .
in some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
systemic allergy , which is rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) but potentially more serious , is a generalised allergy to insulin .
it may cause a rash over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening .
lipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon ( 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
4.9 Overdose
insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels , glucose availability and other metabolic processes .
hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure .
hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness , confusion , palpitations , headache , sweating and vomiting .
mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
if the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient fails to respond to glucagon .
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .
sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
fast-acting human insulin analogue .
ATC code :
A10A B04
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action ( approximately 15 minutes ) , thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal ( within zero to 15 minutes of the meal ) when compared to regular insulin ( 30 to 45 minutes before ) .
insulin lispro takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity ( 2 to 5 hours ) when compared to regular insulin .
5 Clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin .
the typical activity profile following subcutaneous injection is illustrated below .
insulin Lispro
Humulin R Hypoglycaemic Activity
time ( Hours ) The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the subject &apos;s whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of these insulins on glucose metabolism over time .
clinical trials have been performed in children ( 61 patients aged 2 to 11 ) and children and adolescents ( 481 patients aged 9 to 19 years ) , comparing insulin lispro to human soluble insulin .
the pharmacodynamic profile of insulin lispro in children is similar to that seen in adults .
when used in subcutaneous infusion pumps , treatment with insulin lispro has been shown to result in lower glycosylated haemoglobin levels compared to soluble insulin .
in a double-blind , crossover study , the reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin levels after 12 weeks dosing was 0.37 percentage points with insulin lispro , compared to 0.03 percentage points for soluble insulin ( p = 0.004 ) .
in patients with type 2 diabetes on maximum doses of sulphonyl urea agents , studies have shown that the addition of insulin lispro significantly reduces HbA1c compared to sulphonyl urea alone .
the reduction of HbA1c would also be expected with other insulin products e. g. soluble or isophane insulins .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced number of episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin .
in some studies , reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was associated with increased episodes of daytime hypoglycaemia .
the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed , and achieves peak blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection .
when considering the clinical 6 relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves ( as discussed in 5.1 ) .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in in vitro tests , including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells , insulin lispro behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin .
studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin .
acute , one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings .
insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies .

the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
14 The pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed , and achieves peak blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves ( as discussed in 5.1 ) .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in in vitro tests , including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells , insulin lispro behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin .
studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin .
acute , one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings .
insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies .

qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
one ml contains 100U ( equivalent to 3.5mg ) insulin lispro ( recombinant DNA origin produced in E. coli ) .
each container includes 10ml equivalent to 1000U insulin lispro .
Humalog Mix25 consists of 25 insulin lispro solution and 75 insulin lispro protamine suspension .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
suspension for injection .
Humalog Mix25 is a white , sterile suspension .
clinical PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Humalog Mix25 is indicated for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
the dosage should be determined by the physician , according to the requirement of the patient .
Humalog Mix25 may be given shortly before meals .
when necessary , Humalog Mix25 can be given soon after meals .
Humalog Mix25 should only be given by subcutaneous injection .
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously .
subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen .
use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a month .
when administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog Mix25 to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered .
after injection , the site of injection should not be massaged .
patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of Humalog itself is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix25 .
this allows Humalog Mix25 to be given very close to mealtime .
the duration of action of the insulin lispro protamine suspension ( BASAL ) component of Humalog Mix25 is similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) .
the time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual .
as with all insulin preparations , the duration of action of Humalog Mix25 is dependent on dose , site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
4.3 Contraindications
hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any of the excipients .
18 Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously .
transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes , intensified insulin therapy , diabetic nerve disease or medications such as beta-blockers .
a few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness , coma , or death .
the use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment , especially in insulin- dependent diabetics , may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis ; conditions which are potentially lethal .
insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment .
insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances .
adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet .
exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia .
administration of insulin lispro to children below 12 years of age should be considered only in case of an expected benefit when compared to regular insulin .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
insulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy , danazol , beta2 stimulants ( such as ritodrine , salbutamol , terbutaline ) .
mixing Humalog Mix25 with other insulins has not been studied .
the physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix25 .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
19 It is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated ( insulin-dependent or gestational diabetes ) patient throughout pregnancy .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet or both .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
the patient &apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
this may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving , this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer .
severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness , and in extreme cases , death .
no specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented , since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors e. g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise .
local allergy in patients is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
redness , swelling , and itching can occur at the site of insulin injection .
this condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks .
in some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
systemic allergy , which is rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) but potentially more serious , is a generalised allergy to insulin .
it may cause a rash over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening .
lipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon ( 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
4.9 Overdose
insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels , glucose availability and other metabolic processes .
hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure .
hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness , confusion , palpitations , headache , sweating and vomiting .
mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
if the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient fails to respond to glucagon .
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .
20 Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
pharmacological PROPERTIES

Humalog Mix25 is a premixed suspension consisting of insulin lispro ( fast-acting human insulin analogue ) and insulin lispro protamine suspension ( intermediate acting human insulin analogue ) .
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action ( approximately 15 minutes ) , thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal ( within zero to 15 minutes of the meal ) when compared to regular insulin ( 30 to 45 minutes before ) .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix25 .
Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) over a period of approximately 15 hours .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia with Humalog Mix25 compared to human insulin mixture 30 / 70 .
in one clinical study there was a small ( 0.38 mmol / l ) increase in blood glucose levels at night ( 3a. m . ) .

for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
suspension for injection .
Humalog Mix50 is a white sterile suspension .
clinical PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Humalog Mix50 is indicated for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
the dosage should be determined by the physician , according to the requirement of the patient .
Humalog Mix50 may be given shortly before meals .
when necessary , Humalog Mix50 can be given soon after meals .
Humalog Mix50 should only be given by subcutaneous injection .
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously .
subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen .
use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a month .
when administered subcutaneously , care should be taken when injecting Humalog Mix50 to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered .
after injection , the site of injection should not be massaged .
patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of Humalog itself is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix50 .
this allows Humalog Mix50 to be given very close to mealtime .
the duration of action of the insulin lispro protamine suspension ( BASAL ) component of Humalog Mix50 is similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) .
the time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual .
as with all insulin preparations , the duration of action of Humalog Mix50 is dependent on dose , site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
4.3 Contraindications
hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any of the excipients .
32 Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously .
transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes , intensified insulin therapy , diabetic nerve disease or medications such as beta-blockers .
a few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness , coma , or death .
the use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment , especially in insulin- dependent diabetics , may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis ; conditions which are potentially lethal .
insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment .
insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances .
adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet .
exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia .
administration of insulin lispro to children below 12 years of age should be considered only in case of an expected benefit when compared to regular insulin .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
insulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy , danazol , beta2 stimulants ( such as ritodrine , salbutamol , terbutaline ) .
mixing Humalog Mix50 with other insulins has not been studied .
the physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix50 .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
33 It is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated ( insulin-dependent or gestational diabetes ) patient throughout pregnancy .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet , or both .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
the patient &apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
this may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving , this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer .
severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness , and in extreme cases , death .
no specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented , since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors e. g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise .
local allergy in patients is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
redness , swelling , and itching can occur at the site of insulin injection .
this condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks .
in some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
systemic allergy , which is rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) but potentially more serious , is a generalised allergy to insulin .
it may cause a rash over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening .
lipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon ( 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
4.9 Overdose
insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels , glucose availability and other metabolic processes .
hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure .
hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness , confusion , palpitations , headache , sweating and vomiting .
mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
if the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient fails to respond to glucagon .
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .
34 Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmaco-therapeutic group :
ATC Code :
A10A D04 .
Humalog Mix50 is a premixed suspension consisting of insulin lispro ( fast-acting human insulin analogue ) and insulin lispro protamine suspension ( intermediate acting human insulin analogue ) .
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action ( approximately 15 minutes ) , thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal ( within zero to 15 minutes of the meal ) when compared to regular insulin ( 30 to 45 minutes before ) .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix50 .
Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) over a period of approximately 15 hours .
in the figure below the pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix50 and BASAL are illustrated .
Humalog Mix50 Humalog Basal
hypoglycaemic activity
time , hours
the above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the subject &apos;s whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of these insulins on glucose metabolism over time .
35 The glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed , and achieves peak blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection .
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro protamine suspension are consistent with those of an intermediate acting insulin such as NPH .
the pharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix50 are representative of the individual pharmacokinetic properties of the two components .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves ( as discussed in 5.1 ) .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in in vitro tests , including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells , insulin lispro behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin .
studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin .
acute , one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings .
insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies .

data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and
47 increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet or both .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
the patient &apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
this may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving , this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer .
severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness , and in extreme cases , death .
no specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented , since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors e. g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise .
local allergy in patients is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
redness , swelling , and itching can occur at the site of insulin injection .
this condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks .
in some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
systemic allergy , which is rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) but potentially more serious , is a generalised allergy to insulin .
it may cause a rash over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening .
lipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon ( 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
4.9 Overdose
insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels , glucose availability and other metabolic processes .
hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure .
hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness , confusion , palpitations , headache , sweating and vomiting .
mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
if the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient fails to respond to glucagon .
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .
48 Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmaco-therapeutic group :
intermediate acting human insulin analogue .
ATC Code :
A10A C04 .
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) over a period of approximately 15 hours .
the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Humalog BASAL has a prolonged absorption profile , achieving a maximum insulin concentration approximately 6 hours after dosing .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in in vitro tests , including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells , insulin lispro behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin .
studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin .
acute , one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings .
insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies .

name OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Humalog Pen 100 U / ml , solution for injection
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
one ml contains 100U ( equivalent to 3.5mg ) insulin lispro ( recombinant DNA origin produced in E. coli ) .
each container includes 3ml equivalent to 300U insulin lispro .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
solution for injection .
Humalog Pen is a sterile , clear , colourless , aqueous solution .
clinical PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
for the treatment of adults and children with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis .
Humalog Pen is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
the dosage should be determined by the physician , according to the requirement of the patient .
Humalog may be given shortly before meals .
when necessary Humalog can be given soon after meals .
Humalog preparations should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous infusion pump ( see section 4.2 ) and may , although not recommended , also be given by intramuscular injection .
if necessary , Humalog may also be administered intravenously , for example ; for the control of blood glucose levels during ketoacidosis , acute illnesses or during intra and post operative periods .
subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen .
use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a month .
when administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog Pen to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered .
after injection , the site of injection should not be massaged .
patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques .
Humalog Pen takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity ( 2 to 5 hours ) given subcutaneously as compared with regular insulin .
this rapid onset of activity allows a Humalog injection ( or , in the case of administration by continuous subcutaneous infusion , a Humalog bolus ) to be given very close to mealtime .
the time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual .
the faster onset of action compared to soluble human insulin is maintained regardless of injection site .
as with all insulin preparations , the duration of action of Humalog Pen is dependent on dose , site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
Humalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting human insulin or oral sulphonylurea agents , on the advice of a physician .
52 Use of Humalog in an insulin infusion pump :
only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro .
before infusing insulin lispro , the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability or otherwise for the particular pump .
read and follow the instructions that accompany the infusion pump .
use the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump .
change the infusion set every 48 hours .
use aseptic technique when inserting the infusion set .
in the event of a hypoglycaemic episode , the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved .
if repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur , notify your health care professional and consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion .
a pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels .
if an interruption to insulin flow is suspected , follow the instructions in the product literature and if appropriate , notify your health care professional .
when used with an insulin infusion pump , Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin .
intravenous administration of insulin :
intravenous injection of insulin lispro should be carried out following normal clinical practise for intravenous injections , for example by an intravenous bolus or by an infusion system .
frequent monitoring of the blood glucose levels is required .
infusion systems at concentrations from 0.1U / ml to 1.0U / ml insulin lispro in 0.9 sodium chloride or 5 dextrose are stable at room temperature for 48 hours .
it is recommended that the system is primed before starting the infusion to the patient .
4.3 Contraindications
hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any of the excipients .
hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
for fast-acting insulins , any patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across the whole day , particularly nocturnal / fasting glucose control .
conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes , intensified insulin therapy , diabetic nerve disease or medications such as beta-blockers .
a few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness , coma , or death .
the use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment , especially in insulin- dependent diabetics , may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis ; conditions which are potentially lethal .
insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment .
insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances .
53 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet .
exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia .
a consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if hypoglycaemia occurs , it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human insulin .
Humalog should only be used in children in preference to soluble insulin when a fast action of insulin might be beneficial .
for example , in the timing of the injections in relation to meals .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
insulin requirements may be increased by medicinal products with hyperglycaemic activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy , danazol , beta2 stimulants ( such as ritodrine , salbutamol , terbutaline ) .
the physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Pen .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
it is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated ( insulin-dependent or gestational diabetes ) patient throughout pregnancy .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet or both .

the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
insulin lispro takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity ( 2 to 5 hours ) when compared to regular insulin .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin .
the typical activity profile following subcutaneous injection is illustrated below .
55 Insulin lispro Humulin R Hypoglycemic Activity
time ( Hours ) The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the subject &apos;s whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of these insulins on glucose metabolism over time .
clinical trials have been performed in children ( 61 patients aged 2 to 11 ) and children and adolescents ( 481 patients aged 9 to 19 years ) , comparing insulin lispro to human soluble insulin .
the pharmacodynamic profile of insulin lispro in children is similar to that seen in adults .
when used in subcutaneous infusion pumps , treatment with insulin lispro has been shown to result in lower glycosylated haemoglobin levels compared to soluble insulin .
in a double-blind , crossover study , the reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin levels after 12 weeks dosing was 0.37 percentage points with insulin lispro , compared to 0.03 percentage points for soluble insulin ( p = 0.004 ) .
in patients with type 2 diabetes on maximum doses of sulphonyl urea agents , studies have shown that the addition of insulin lispro significantly reduces HbA1c compared to sulphonyl urea alone .
the reduction of HbA1c would also be expected with other insulin products e. g. soluble or isophane insulins .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced number of episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin .
in some studies , reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was associated with increased episodes of daytime hypoglycaemia .
the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed , and achieves peak blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves ( as discussed in 5.1 ) .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid 56 absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .

mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
if the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .
sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmaco-therapeutic group :
ATC Code :
A10A D04 .
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action ( approximately 15 minutes ) , thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal ( within zero to 15 minutes of the meal ) when compared to regular insulin ( 30 to 45 minutes before ) .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix25 .
Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) over a period of approximately 15 hours .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia with Humalog Mix25 compared to human insulin mixture 30 / 70 .
in one clinical study there was a small ( 0.38 mmol / l ) increase in blood glucose levels at night ( 3a. m . ) .
in the figure below the pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix25 and BASAL are illustrated .

63 The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the subject &apos;s whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of these insulins on glucose metabolism over time .
the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed , and achieves peak blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection .
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro protamine suspension are consistent with those of an intermediate acting insulin such as NPH .
the pharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix25 are representative of the individual pharmacokinetic properties of the two components .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves ( as discussed in 5.1 ) .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in in vitro tests , including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells , insulin lispro behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin .
studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin .
acute , one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings .
insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies .

Humalog Mix50 100 U / ml Pen , suspension for injection
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
one ml contains 100U ( equivalent to 3.5mg ) insulin lispro ( recombinant DNA origin produced in E. coli ) .
each container includes 3ml equivalent to 300U insulin lispro .
Humalog Mix50 consists of 50 insulin lispro solution and 50 insulin lispro protamine suspension .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
suspension for injection .
Humalog Mix50 is a white , sterile suspension .
clinical PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Humalog Mix50 is indicated for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
the dosage should be determined by the physician , according to the requirement of the patient .
Humalog Mix50 may be given shortly before meals .
when necessary , Humalog Mix50 can be given soon after meals .
Humalog Mix50 should only be given by subcutaneous injection .
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously .
subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen .
use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a month .
when administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog Mix50 to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered .
after injection , the site of injection should not be massaged .
patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of Humalog itself is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix50 .
this allows Humalog Mix50 to be given very close to mealtime .
the duration of action of the insulin lispro protamine suspension ( BASAL ) component of Humalog Mix50 is similar to that of a basal insulin NPH .
the time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual .
as with all insulin preparations , the duration of action of Humalog Mix50 is dependent on dose , site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
4.3 Contraindications
hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any of the excipients .
68 Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously .
transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes , intensified insulin therapy , diabetic nerve disease or medications such as beta-blockers .
a few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness , coma , or death .
the use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment , especially in insulin- dependent diabetics , may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis ; conditions which are potentially lethal .
insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment .
insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances .
adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet .
exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia .
administration of insulin lispro to children below 12 years of age should be considered only in case of an expected benefit when compared to regular insulin .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
insulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy , danazol , beta2 stimulants ( such as ritodrine , salbutamol , terbutaline ) .
mixing Humalog Mix50 with other insulins has not been studied .
the physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix50 .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
69 It is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated ( insulin-dependent or gestational diabetes ) patient throughout pregnancy .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet or both .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
the patient &apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
this may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving , this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer .
severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness , and in extreme cases , death .
no specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented , since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors e. g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise .
local allergy in patients is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
redness , swelling , and itching can occur at the site of insulin injection .
this condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks .
in some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
systemic allergy , which is rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) but potentially more serious , is a generalised allergy to insulin .
it may cause a rash over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening .
lipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon ( 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
4.9 Overdose
insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels , glucose availability and other metabolic processes .
hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin acitivity relative to food intake and energy expenditure .
hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness , confusion , palpitations , headache , sweating and vomiting .
mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
if the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
intermediate acting human insulin analogue .
ATC Code :
A10A C04 .
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) over a period of approximately 15 hours .
the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Humalog BASAL has a prolonged absorption profile , achieving a maximum insulin concentration approximately 6 hours after dosing .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves properties .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in in vitro tests , including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells , insulin lispro behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin .
studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin .
acute , one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings .
insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies .

instructions for use and handling a ) Preparing a dose
inspect the Humalog BASAL 100 U / ml Pen .
the Pen should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180 ten times immediately before use to resuspend the insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky .
if not , repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed .
cartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing .
do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose .
the cartridges should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge , giving a frosted appearance .
put on the needle .
wipe the rubber seal with alcohol .
remove the paper tab from the capped needle .
screw the capped needle clockwise onto the pen until it is tight .
hold the pen with needle pointing up and remove the outer needle cap and inner needle cover .
priming Pen ( check insulin flow )

name OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Humalog 100 U / ml KwikPen , solution for injection
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
one ml contains 100U ( equivalent to 3.5mg ) insulin lispro ( recombinant DNA origin produced in E. coli ) .
each container includes 3ml equivalent to 300U insulin lispro .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
solution for injection .
Humalog KwikPen is a sterile , clear , colourless , aqueous solution .
clinical PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
for the treatment of adults and children with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis .
Humalog KwikPen is also indicated for the initial stabilisation of diabetes mellitus .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
the dosage should be determined by the physician , according to the requirement of the patient .
Humalog may be given shortly before meals .
when necessary Humalog can be given soon after meals .
Humalog preparations should be given by subcutaneous injection or by continuous subcutaneous infusion pump ( see section 4.2 ) and may , although not recommended , also be given by intramuscular injection .
if necessary , Humalog may also be administered intravenously , for example ; for the control of blood glucose levels during ketoacidosis , acute illnesses or during intra and post operative periods .
subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen .
use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a month .
when administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog KwikPen to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered .
after injection , the site of injection should not be massaged .
patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques .
Humalog KwikPen takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity ( 2 to 5 hours ) given subcutaneously as compared with regular insulin .
this rapid onset of activity allows a Humalog injection ( or , in the case of administration by continuous subcutaneous infusion , a Humalog bolus ) to be given very close to mealtime .
the time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual .
the faster onset of action compared to soluble human insulin is maintained regardless of injection site .
as with all insulin preparations , the duration of action of Humalog KwikPen is dependent on dose , site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
Humalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting human insulin or oral sulphonylurea agents , on the advice of a physician .
83 Use of Humalog in an insulin infusion pump :
only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro .
before infusing insulin lispro , the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability or otherwise for the particular pump .
read and follow the instructions that accompany the infusion pump .
use the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump .
change the infusion set every 48 hours .
use aseptic technique when inserting the infusion set .
in the event of a hypoglycaemic episode , the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved .
if repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur , notify your health care professional and consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion .
a pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels .
if an interruption to insulin flow is suspected , follow the instructions in the product literature and if appropriate , notify your health care professional .
when used with an insulin infusion pump , Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin .
intravenous administration of insulin :
intravenous injection of insulin lispro should be carried out following normal clinical practise for intravenous injections , for example by an intravenous bolus or by an infusion system .
frequent monitoring of the blood glucose levels is required .
infusion systems at concentrations from 0.1U / ml to 1.0U / ml insulin lispro in 0.9 sodium chloride or 5 dextrose are stable at room temperature for 48 hours .
it is recommended that the system is primed before starting the infusion to the patient .
4.3 Contraindications
hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any of the excipients .
hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
for fast-acting insulins , any patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across the whole day , particularly nocturnal / fasting glucose control .
conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes , intensified insulin therapy , diabetic nerve disease or medications such as beta-blockers .
a few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness , coma , or death .
the use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment , especially in insulin- dependent diabetics , may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis ; conditions which are potentially lethal .
insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment .
insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances .
84 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet .
exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia .
a consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if hypoglycaemia occurs , it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human insulin .
Humalog should only be used in children in preference to soluble insulin when a fast action of insulin might be beneficial .
for example , in the timing of the injections in relation to meals .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
insulin requirements may be increased by medicinal products with hyperglycaemic activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy , danazol , beta2 stimulants ( such as ritodrine , salbutamol , terbutaline ) .
the physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog KwikPen .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
it is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated ( insulin-dependent or gestational diabetes ) patient throughout pregnancy .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet or both .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
the patient &apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
this may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving , this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer .
severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness , and in extreme cases , death .
no specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented , since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors e. g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise .
local allergy in patients is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
redness , swelling , and itching can occur at the site of insulin injection .
this condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks .
in some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
it may cause a rash over the whole
85 body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening .
lipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon ( 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
4.9 Overdose
insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels , glucose availability and other metabolic processes .
hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure .
hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness , confusion , palpitations , headache , sweating and vomiting .
mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
if the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient fails to respond to glucagon .
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .
sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group :
A10A B04
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
within muscle tissue this includes increasing glycogen , fatty acid , glycerol and protein synthesis and amino acid uptake , while decreasing glycogenolysis , gluconeogenesis , ketogenesis , lipolysis , protein catabolism and amino acid output .
insulin lispro takes effect rapidly and has a shorter duration of activity ( 2 to 5 hours ) when compared to regular insulin .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin .
the typical activity profile following subcutaneous injection is illustrated below .
86 Insulin lispro Humulin R Hypoglycemic Activity
time ( Hours ) The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the subject &apos;s whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of these insulins on glucose metabolism over time .
clinical trials have been performed in children ( 61 patients aged 2 to 11 ) and children and adolescents ( 481 patients aged 9 to 19 years ) , comparing insulin lispro to human soluble insulin .
the pharmacodynamic profile of insulin lispro in children is similar to that seen in adults .
when used in subcutaneous infusion pumps , treatment with insulin lispro has been shown to result in lower glycosylated haemoglobin levels compared to soluble insulin .
in a double-blind , crossover study , the reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin levels after 12 weeks dosing was 0.37 percentage points with insulin lispro , compared to 0.03 percentage points for soluble insulin ( p = 0.004 ) .
in patients with type 2 diabetes on maximum doses of sulphonyl urea agents , studies have shown that the addition of insulin lispro significantly reduces HbA1c compared to sulphonyl urea alone .
the reduction of HbA1c would also be expected with other insulin products e. g. soluble or isophane insulins .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced number of episodes of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to soluble human insulin .
in some studies , reduction of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was associated with increased episodes of daytime hypoglycaemia .
the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed , and achieves peak blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves ( as discussed in 5.1 ) .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid 87 absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data
in in vitro tests , including binding to insulin receptor sites and effects on growing cells , insulin lispro behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin .
studies also demonstrate that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin lispro is equivalent to human insulin .
acute , one month and twelve month toxicology studies produced no significant toxicity findings .
insulin lispro did not induce fertility impairment , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animal studies .

Pharmaco-therapeutic group :
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action ( approximately 15 minutes ) , thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal ( within zero to 15 minutes of the meal ) when compared to regular insulin ( 30 to 45 minutes before ) .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix25 .
Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) over a period of approximately 15 hours .
clinical trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial hyperglycaemia with Humalog Mix25 compared to human insulin mixture 30 / 70 .
in one clinical study there was a small ( 0.38 mmol / l ) increase in blood glucose levels at night ( 3a. m . ) .

name OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Humalog Mix50 100 U / ml KwikPen , suspension for injection
qualitative AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
one ml contains 100U ( equivalent to 3.5mg ) insulin lispro ( recombinant DNA origin produced in E. coli ) .
each container includes 3ml equivalent to 300U insulin lispro .
Humalog Mix50 consists of 50 insulin lispro solution and 50 insulin lispro protamine suspension .
for a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
pharmaceutical FORM
suspension for injection .
Humalog Mix50 is a white , sterile suspension .
clinical PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Humalog Mix50 is indicated for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
the dosage should be determined by the physician , according to the requirement of the patient .
Humalog Mix50 may be given shortly before meals .
when necessary , Humalog Mix50 can be given soon after meals .
Humalog Mix50 should only be given by subcutaneous injection .
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously .
subcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms , thighs , buttocks , or abdomen .
use of injection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a month .
when administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog Mix50 to ensure that a blood vessel has not been entered .
after injection , the site of injection should not be massaged .
patients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of Humalog itself is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix50 .
this allows Humalog Mix50 to be given very close to mealtime .
the duration of action of the insulin lispro protamine suspension ( BASAL ) component of Humalog Mix50 is similar to that of a basal insulin NPH .
the time course of action of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual .
as with all insulin preparations , the duration of action of Humalog Mix50 is dependent on dose , site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
4.3 Contraindications
hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any of the excipients .
97 Hypoglycaemia .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix50 be given intravenously .
transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes , intensified insulin therapy , diabetic nerve disease or medications such as beta-blockers .
a few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
uncorrected hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness , coma , or death .
the use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment , especially in insulin- dependent diabetics , may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis ; conditions which are potentially lethal .
insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment .
insulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances .
adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or change their usual diet .
exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia .
administration of insulin lispro to children below 12 years of age should be considered only in case of an expected benefit when compared to regular insulin .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
insulin requirements may be increased by substances with hyperglycaemic activity , such as oral contraceptives , corticosteroids , or thyroid replacement therapy , danazol , beta2 stimulants ( such as ritodrine , salbutamol , terbutaline ) .
mixing Humalog Mix50 with other insulins has not been studied .
the physician should be consulted when using other medications in addition to Humalog Mix50 KwikPen .
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
98 Data on a large number of exposed pregnancies do not indicate any adverse effect of insulin lispro on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus / newborn .
it is essential to maintain good control of the insulin-treated ( insulin-dependent or gestational diabetes ) patient throughout pregnancy .
insulin requirements usually fall during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters .
patients with diabetes should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy .
careful monitoring of glucose control , as well as general health , is essential in pregnant patients with diabetes .
patients with diabetes who are breast-feeding may require adjustments in insulin dose , diet or both .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
the patient &apos;s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
this may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving , this is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
the advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
4.8 Undesirable effects
hypoglycaemia is the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy that a patient with diabetes may suffer .
severe hypoglycaemia may lead to loss of consciousness , and in extreme cases , death .
no specific frequency for hypoglycaemia is presented , since hypoglycaemia is a result of both the insulin dose and other factors e. g. a patient`s level of diet and exercise .
local allergy in patients is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
redness , swelling , and itching can occur at the site of insulin injection .
this condition usually resolves in a few days to a few weeks .
in some instances , this condition may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
systemic allergy , which is rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) but potentially more serious , is a generalised allergy to insulin .
it may cause a rash over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , fast pulse , or sweating .
severe cases of generalised allergy may be life-threatening .
lipodystrophy at the injection site is uncommon ( 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
4.9 Overdose
insulins have no specific overdose definitions because serum glucose concentrations are a result of complex interactions between insulin levels , glucose availability and other metabolic processes .
hypoglycaemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin acitivity relative to food intake and energy expenditure .
hypoglycaemia may be associated with listlessness , confusion , palpitations , headache , sweating and vomiting .
mild hypoglycaemic episodes will respond to oral administration of glucose or other sugar or saccharated products .
correction of moderately severe hypoglycaemia can be accomplished by intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of glucagon , followed by oral carbohydrate when the patient recovers sufficiently .
patients who fail to respond to glucagon must be given glucose solution intravenously .
99 If the patient is comatose , glucagon should be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
however , glucose solution must be given intravenously if glucagon is not available or if the patient fails to respond to glucagon .
the patient should be given a meal as soon as consciousness is recovered .
sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
pharmacological PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmaco-therapeutic group :
the primary activity of insulin lispro is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
in addition , insulins have several anabolic and anti-catabolic actions on a variety of different tissues .
insulin lispro has a rapid onset of action ( approximately 15 minutes ) , thus allowing it to be given closer to a meal ( within zero to 15 minutes of the meal ) when compared to regular insulin ( 30 to 45 minutes before ) .
the rapid onset and early peak of activity of insulin lispro is observed following the subcutaneous administration of Humalog Mix50 .
Humalog BASAL has an activity profile that is very similar to that of a basal insulin ( NPH ) over a period of approximately 15 hours .
in the figure below the pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix50 and BASAL are illustrated .
Humalog Mix50 Humalog Basal
hypoglycaemic activity
time , hours
100 The above representation reflects the relative amount of glucose over time required to maintain the subject &apos;s whole blood glucose concentrations near fasting levels and is an indicator of the effect of these insulins on glucose metabolism over time .
the glucodynamic response to insulin lispro is not affected by renal or hepatic function impairment .
glucodynamic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin , as measured during a glucose clamp procedure , were maintained over a wide range of renal function .
insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and of a shorter duration .
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro reflect a compound that is rapidly absorbed , and achieves peak blood levels 30 to 70 minutes following subcutaneous injection .
the pharmacokinetics of insulin lispro protamine suspension are consistent with those of an intermediate acting insulin such as NPH .
the pharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix50 are representative of the individual pharmacokinetic properties of the two components .
when considering the clinical relevance of these kinetics , it is more appropriate to examine the glucose utilisation curves ( as discussed in 5.1 ) .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with renal impairment .
in patients with type 2 diabetes over a wide range of renal function the pharmacokinetic differences between insulin lispro and soluble human insulin were generally maintained and shown to be independent of renal function .
insulin lispro maintains more rapid absorption and elimination when compared to soluble human insulin in patients with hepatic impairment .
5.3 Preclinical safety data

further information
what HUMALOG IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Humalog is used to treat diabetes .
Humalog works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed slightly .
you get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood .
Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term .
it works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin ( 2 to 5 hours ) .
you should normally use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal .
your doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin .
each kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
be very careful if you do change insulin .
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children .
Humalog may be used in children , when an advantage is expected compared to soluble insulin , for example , in the timing of the injection in relation to meals .
before YOU USE HUMALOG
do not use Humalog
- if you think hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) is starting .
further in this leaflet it tells you
how to deal with mild hypoglycaemia .
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of Humalog .
take special care with Humalog If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy , you may not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low .
WARNING signs are listed later in this leaflet .
you must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood glucose often .
if you often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it , please discuss this with your doctor . if you answer YES to any of the following questions , tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse
have you recently become ill ?
do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver ?
are you exercising more than usual ?
the amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol . you should also tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad .
the time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals at different times from when you are at home .
please tell your doctor , if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
pregnancy and breast-feeding Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant , or are you breast-feeding ?
the amount of insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining six months .
if you are breast-feeding , you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet .
ask your doctor for advice .
driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia .
please keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
you should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you have : frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia
how TO USE HUMALOG
always check the pack and the vial label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from your pharmacy .
make sure you get the Humalog that your doctor has told you to use .
always use Humalog exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor if you are not sure .
dosage You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal .
if you need to , you can inject soon after a meal .
but your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use , when to use it , and how often .
these instructions are only for you .
follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly . if you change the type of insulin you use ( for example from a human or animal insulin to a Humalog product ) , you may have to take more or less than before .
this might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months . inject Humalog under the skin .
you should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told you to .
188 Preparing Humalog Humalog is already dissolved in water , so you do not need to mix it .
but you must use it only if it looks like water .
it must be clear , have no colour and no solid pieces in it .
check each time you inject yourself .
injecting Humalog First wash your hands . before you make an injection , clean your skin as you have been instructed .
clean the rubber stopper on the vial , but do not remove the stopper . use a clean , sterile syringe and needle to pierce the rubber stopper and draw in the amount of Humalog you want .
your doctor or clinic will tell you how to do this .
do not share your needles and syringes . inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
after your injection , leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose .
do not rub the area you have just injected .
make sure you inject at least half an inch ( 1 cm ) from the last injection and that you rotate &apos;the places you inject , as you have been taught .
it doesn &apos;t matter which injection site you use , either upper arm , thigh , buttock or abdomen , your Humalog injection will still work quicker than soluble human insulin . your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Humalog with one of the human insulins .
for example if you do need to inject a mixture , draw the Humalog into the syringe before the long acting insulin .
inject the liquid as soon as you have mixed it .
do the same thing every time .
you should not normally mix Humalog with one of the mixtures of human insulins .
you should never mix Humalog with insulins produced by other manufacturers or animal insulins . you must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route .
inject Humalog as your physician or nurse has taught you .
only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route .
he will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your glucose levels are too high .
using Humalog in an infusion pump Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro .
before infusing insulin lispro , the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability or otherwise for the particular pump .
read and follow the instructions in the product literature supplied with the infusion pump . be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump . change the infusion set every 48 hours .
use aseptic technique when inserting the infusion set . in the event of a hypoglycaemic episode , the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved .
if repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur , notify your doctor or clinic and consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion . a pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels .
if an interruption to insulin flow is suspected , follow the instructions in the product literature and if appropriate , notify your doctor or clinic . when used with an insulin infusion pump , Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin .
if you take more Humalog than you need If you take more Humalog than you need , a low blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar .
if your blood sugar is low , eat glucose tablets , sugar or drink a sugary drink .
then eat fruit , biscuits , or a sandwich , as your doctor has advised you and have some rest .
this will often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose .
if you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale , tell your doctor at once .
a glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia .
eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection .
if you do not respond to glucagon , you will have to go to hospital .
ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon .
if you forget to use Humalog If you take less Humalog than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar .
if you take less Humalog than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
if you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Humalog can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .

what HUMALOG IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Humalog is used to tre at diabetes .
Humalog works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed slightly .
you get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood .
Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term .
it works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin ( 2 to 5 hours ) .
you should normally use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal .
your doctor may tell you to use Humalog as well as a longer-acting insulin .
each kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
be very careful if you do change insulin .
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children .
Humalog may be used in children , when an advantage is expected compared to soluble insulin , for example , in the timing of the injection in relation to meals .
before YOU USE HUMALOG
do not use Humalog
further in this leaflet it tells you
how to deal with mild hypoglycaemia .
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of Humalog .
take special care with Humalog If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy , you may not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low .
WARNING signs are listed later in this leaflet .
if you often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it , please discuss this with your doctor . if you answer YES to any of the following questions , tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse
have you recently become ill ?
do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver ?
are you exercising more than usual ?
the amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol . you should also tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad .
please tell your doctor , if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
pregnancy and breast-feeding Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant , or are you breast-feeding ?
the amount of insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining six months .
if you are breast-feeding , you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet .
ask your doctor for advice .
driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia .
please keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk ( e.g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
you should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you have : frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia
how TO USE HUMALOG
the 3 ml cartridge is only for use in 3ml pens .
it is not for use in 1.5 ml pens .
always check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from your pharmacy .
make sure you get the Humalog that your doctor has told you to use .
always use Humalog exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor if you are not sure .
dosage You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal .
if you need to , you can inject soon after a meal .
but your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use , when to use it , and how often .
these instructions are only for you .
195 If you change the type of insulin you use ( for example from a human or animal insulin to a Humalog product ) , you may have to take more or less than before .
this might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months . inject Humalog under the skin .
you should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told you to .
preparing Humalog Humalog is already dissolved in water , so you do not need to mix it .
but you must use it only if it looks like water .
it must be clear , have no colour and no solid pieces in it .
check each time you inject yourself .
getting the pen ready to use First wash your hands .
disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge . you must only use Humalog cartridges in compatible CE marked pens .
please make sure that Humalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen .
the 3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen . follow the instructions that come with the pen .
put the cartridge into the pen . you will set the dose to 1 or 2 units .
then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the side of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top .
with the pen still pointing up , press the injection mechanism .
do this until a drop of Humalog comes out of the needle .
there may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen .
these are harmless , but if the air bubble is too big , it may make the dose of your injection less accurate .
injecting Humalog Before you make an injection , clean your skin as you have been instructed .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
after your injection , leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose .
do not rub the area you have just injected .
make sure you inject at least half an inch ( 1 cm ) from the last injection and that you rotate &apos;the places you inject , as you have been taught .
it doesn t matter which injection site you use , either upper arm , thigh , buttock or abdomen , your Humalog injection will still work quicker than soluble human insulin . you must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route .
inject Humalog as your physician or nurse has taught you .
only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route .
he will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your glucose levels are too high .
after injecting As soon as you have done the injection , take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap .
this will keep the Humalog sterile and prevent leaking .
it will also stop air going back into the pen and the needle clogging up .
do not share your needles .
do not share your pen .
replace the cap on your pen .
further injections Leave the cartridge in the pen .
before every injection , dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing up until a drop of Humalog comes out of the needle .
you can see how much Humalog is left by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge .
the distance between each mark on the gauge is about 20 units .
if there is not enough for your dose , change the cartridge .
do not mix any other insulin in a Humalog cartridge .
once the cartridge is empty , do not use it again .
using Humalog in an infusion pump Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro .
before infusing insulin lispro , the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the
read and follow the instructions in the product literature supplied with the infusion pump . be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump . change the infusion set every 48 hours .
use aseptic technique when inserting the infusion set . in the event of a hypoglycaemic episode , the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved .
if repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur , notify your doctor or clinic and consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion . a pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels .
if an interruption to insulin flow is suspected , follow the instructions in the product literature and if appropriate , notify your doctor or clinic . when used with an insulin infusion pump , Humalog should not be mixed with any other insulin .
if you take more Humalog than you need If you take more Humalog than you need , a low blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar .
if your blood sugar is low , eat glucose tablets , sugar or drink a sugary drink .
then eat fruit , biscuits , or a sandwich , as your doctor has advised you and have some rest .
this will often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose .
if you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale , tell your doctor at once .
a glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia .
eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection .
if you do not respond to glucagon , you will have to go to hospital .
ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon .
if you forget to use Humalog If you take less Humalog than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar

further information
what HUMALOG BASAL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Humalog BASAL is used to treat diabetes .
its active substance is insulin lispro .
the insulin lispro in Humalog BASAL is available in a suspension together with protamine sulphate , so that its action is prolonged .
you get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood .
Humalog BASAL is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term .
Humalog BASAL has a prolonged mode of action compared to soluble insulin .
your doctor may tell you to use Humalog BASAL as well as a fast-acting insulin .
each kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
be very careful if you do change insulin .
before YOU USE HUMALOG BASAL
do not use Humalog BASAL
- if you think hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) is starting .
further in this leaflet it tells you
how to deal with mild hypoglycaemia .
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of Humalog
Basal .
take special care with Humalog BASAL If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy , you may not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low .
WARNING signs are listed later in this leaflet .
you must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood glucose often . a few people who have had hypoglycaemia after switching from animal insulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms were less obvious or different .
if you often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising them , please discuss this with your doctor .
232 If you answer YES to any of the following questions , tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse
have you recently become ill ?
do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver ?
are you exercising more than usual ?
the amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol . you should also tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad .
the time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals at different times from when you are at home .
please tell your doctor , if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
pregnancy and breast-feeding Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant , or are you breast-feeding ?
the amount of insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining six months .
if you are breast-feeding , you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet .
ask your doctor for advice .
driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia .
please keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk ( e.g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
you should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you have : frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia
how TO USE HUMALOG BASAL
the 3 ml cartridge is only for use in 3ml pens .
it is not for use in 1.5 ml pens .
always check the pack and the cartridge label for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from your pharmacy .
make sure you get the Humalog BASAL that your doctor has told you to use .
always use Humalog BASAL exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor if you are not sure .
dosage You should normally inject Humalog BASAL as your basal insulin .
your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use , when to use it , and how often .
these instructions are only for you .
follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly . if you change the type of insulin you use ( for example from a human or animal insulin to a Humalog product ) , you may have to take more or less than before .
this might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months . inject Humalog BASAL under the skin .
you should not administer it using a different administration route .
under no circumstances should Humalog BASAL be given intravenously .
233 Preparing Humalog BASAL Cartridges containing Humalog BASAL should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180 ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky .
if not , repeat the above procedure until contents are mixed .
cartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing .
do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose .
the cartridges should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge , giving it a frosted appearance .
check each time you inject yourself .
getting the pen ready to use First wash your hands .
disinfect the rubber membrane of the cartridge . you must only use Humalog BASAL cartridges in compatible CE marked pens .
please make sure that Humalog or Lilly cartridges are mentioned in the leaflet accompanying your pen .
the 3 ml cartridge only fits the 3 ml pen . follow the instructions that come with the pen .
put the cartridge into the pen . you will set the dose to 1 or 2 units .
then hold the pen with the needle pointing up and tap the side of the pen so that any bubbles float to the top .
with the pen still pointing up , press the injection mechanism .
do this until a drop of Humalog BASAL comes out of the needle .
there may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen .
these are harmless , but if the air bubble is too big , it may make the dose of your injection less accurate .
injecting Humalog BASAL Before you make an injection , clean your skin as you have been instructed .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
after your injection , leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose .
do not rub the area you have just injected .
make sure you inject at least half an inch ( 1 cm ) from the last injection and that you rotate &apos;the places you inject , as you have been taught .
after injecting As soon as you have done the injection , take the needle off the pen using the outer needle cap .
this will keep the Humalog BASAL sterile and prevent leaking .
it will also stop air going back into the pen and the needle clogging up .
do not share your needles .
do not share your pen .
replace the cap on your pen .
further injections Leave the cartridge in the pen .
before every injection , dial 1 or 2 units and press the injection mechanism with the pen pointing up until a drop of Humalog BASAL comes out of the needle .
you can see how much Humalog is left by looking at the gauge on the side of the cartridge .
the distance between each mark on the gauge is about 20 units .
if there is not enough for your dose , change the cartridge .
do not mix any other insulin in a Humalog BASAL cartridge .
once the cartridge is empty , do not use it again .
if you take more Humalog BASAL than you need If you take more Humalog BASAL than you need , a low blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar .
if your blood sugar is low , eat glucose tablets , sugar or drink a sugary drink .
then eat fruit , biscuits , or a sandwich , as your doctor has advised you and have some rest .
this will often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose .
if you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale , tell your doctor at once .
a glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia .
eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection .
if you do not respond to glucagon , you will have to go to hospital .
ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon .
234 If you forget to use Humalog BASAL If you take less Humalog BASAL than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar
if you take less Humalog BASAL than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
if you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .

further information
what HUMALOG PEN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Humalog Pen is used to treat diabetes .
it works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed slightly .
you get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood .
Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term .
it works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin ( 2 to 5 hours ) .
you should normally use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal .
your doctor may tell you to use Humalog Pen as well as a longer-acting insulin .
each kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
be very careful if you do change insulin .
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children .
Humalog may be used in children , when an advantage is expected compared to soluble insulin , for example , in the timing of the injection in relation to meals .

you get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood .
Humalog Mix50 is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term .

check the label on the pen to be sure the pen contains the type of insulin that has been prescribed for you .
always wash your hands before preparing your pen for use .
pull the pen cap to remove .
if your insulin is a suspension ( cloudy ) :
roll the pen back and forth 10 times then perform step b .
gently turn the pen up and down 10 times until the insulin is evenly mixed .
suspension ( cloudy ) insulin cartridges contain a small bead to assist in mixing .
use an alcohol swab to wipe the rubber seal on the end of the pen .
272 II .
attaching the Needle
this device is suitable for use with Becton Dickinson and Company s insulin pen needles .
always use a new needle for each injection .
do not push injection button without a needle attached .
storing the pen with the needle attached may allow insulin to leak from the pen and air bubbles to form in the cartridge .

not sure how much insulin remains in the cartridge
hold the pen with the needle end pointing down .
the scale ( 20 units between marks ) on the clear insulin cartridge holder s hows an estimate of the number of units remaining .
these numbers should not be used for measuring an insulin dose .
full dose cannot be dialled .
the pen will not allow you to dial a dose greater than the number of insulin units remaining in the cartridge .
for example , if you need 31 units and only 25 units remain in the pen you will not be able to dial past 25 .
do not attempt to dial past this point .
( the insulin that remains is unusable and not part of the 300 units . ) If a partial dose remains in the pen you may either :
1 ) Give the partial dose and then give the remaining dose using a new pen , or 2 ) Give the full dose with a new pen .
a small amount of insulin remains in the cartridge but a dose cannot be dialled .
the pen design prevents the cartridge from being completely emptied .
the pen has delivered 300 units of usable insulin .
cannot completely push in the injection button when priming the pen or injecting a dose .
if you are sure insulin is coming out of the needle , push in the injection button more slowly to reduce the effort needed and maintain a constant pressure until the injection button is completely pushed in .

further information
what HUMALOG KWIKPEN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Humalog KwikPen is used to treat diabetes .
it works more quickly than normal human insulin because the insulin molecule has been changed slightly .
you get diabetes if your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood .
Humalog is a substitute for your own insulin and is used to control glucose in the long term .
it works very quickly and lasts a shorter time than soluble insulin ( 2 to 5 hours ) .
you should normally use Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal .
your doctor may tell you to use Humalog KwikPen as well as a longer-acting insulin .
each kind of insulin comes with another patient information leaflet to tell you about it .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
be very careful if you do change insulin .
Humalog is suitable for use in adults and children .
Humalog may be used in children , when an advantage is expected compared to soluble insulin , for example , in the timing of the injection in relation to meals .
before YOU USE HUMALOG KWIKPEN
do not use Humalog KwikPen
- if you think hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) is starting .
further in this leaflet it tells you
how to deal with mild hypoglycaemia .
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to insulin lispro or any of the other ingredients of Humalog
KwikPen .
take special care with Humalog KwikPen If your blood sugar levels are well controlled by your current insulin therapy , you may not feel the warning symptoms when your blood sugar is falling too low .
WARNING signs are listed later in this leaflet .
you must also keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels by testing your blood glucose often .
if you often have hypoglycaemia or have difficulty recognising it , please discuss this with your doctor . if you answer YES to any of the following questions , tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse
have you recently become ill ?
do you have trouble with your kidneys or liver ?
are you exercising more than usual ?
the amount of insulin you need may also change if you drink alcohol . you should also tell your doctor , pharmacist or diabetes nurse if you are planning to go abroad .
the time difference between countries may mean that you have to have your injections and meals at different times from when you are at home .
please tell your doctor , if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
pregnancy and breast-feeding Are you pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant , or are you breast-feeding ?
the amount of insulin you need usually falls during the first three months of pregnancy and increases for the remaining six months .
if you are breast-feeding , you may need to alter your insulin intake or diet .
ask your doctor for advice .
driving and using machines Your ability to concentrate and react may be reduced if you have hypoglycaemia .
please keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk ( e.g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
you should contact your doctor about the advisability of driving if you have : frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycaemia
how TO USE HUMALOG KWIKPEN
always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from your pharmacy .
make sure you get the Humalog KwikPen that your doctor has told you to use .
always use Humalog KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor if you are not sure .
dosage You should normally inject Humalog within 15 minutes of a meal .
if you need to , you can inject soon after a meal .
but your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use , when to use it , and how often .
these instructions are only for you .
follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly . if you change the type of insulin you use ( for example from a human or animal insulin to a Humalog product ) , you may have to take more or less than before .
this might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months . inject Humalog under the skin .
you should only inject it into a muscle if your doctor has told you to .
284 Preparing Humalog KwikPen Humalog is already dissolved in water , so you do not need to mix it .
but you must use it only if it looks like water .
it must be clear , have no colour and no solid pieces in it .
check each time you inject yourself .
please follow the instructions carefully .
( needles are not included ) . prime your KwikPen before each use .
this checks that insulin comes out and clears the air bubbles from your KwikPen .
there may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these are harmless .
but if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose .
injecting Humalog Before you make an injection , clean your skin as you have been instructed .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
after your injection , leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose .
do not rub the area you have just injected .
make sure you inject at least half an inch ( 1 cm ) from the last injection and that you rotate &apos;the places you inject , as you have been taught .
it doesn t matter which injection site you use , either upper arm , thigh , buttock or abdomen , your Humalog injection will still work quicker than soluble human insulin . you must not administer Humalog by the intravenous route .
inject Humalog as your physician or nurse has taught you .
only your physician can administer Humalog by the intravenous route .
he will only do this under special circumstances such as surgery or if you are ill and your glucose levels are too high .
after injecting As soon as you have done the injection , unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer needle cap .
this will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking .
it also stops air entering the pen and your needle clogging .
do not share your needles .
do not share your pen .
replace the cap on your pen .
further injections Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle .
before every injection , clear any air bubbles .
you can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing up .
the scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left . do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen .
once the KwikPen is empty , do not use it again .
please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do this .
using Humalog in an infusion pump Only certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro .
before infusing insulin lispro , the manufacturers instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability or otherwise for the particular pump .
read and follow the instructions in the product literature supplied with the infusion pump . be sure to use the correct reservoir and catheter for your pump . change the infusion set every 48 hours .
use aseptic technique when inserting the infusion set . in the event of a hypoglycaemic episode , the infusion should be stopped until the episode is resolved .
if repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur , notify your doctor or clinic and consider the need to reduce or stop your insulin infusion . a pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in a rapid rise in glucose levels .
if an interruption to insulin flow is suspected , follow the instructions in the product literature and if appropriate , notify your doctor or clinic .
if you take more Humalog than you need If you take more Humalog than you need , a low blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar .
if your blood sugar is low , eat glucose tablets , sugar or drink a sugary drink .
then eat fruit , biscuits , or a sandwich , as your doctor has advised you and have some rest .
this will often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose .
if you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale , tell your doctor at once .
a glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia .
eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection .
if you do not respond to glucagon , you will have to go to hospital .
ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon .
if you forget to use Humalog If you take less Humalog than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar
if you take less Humalog than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to .
if you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
possible SIDE EFFECTS
like all medicines , Humalog can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
local allergy is common ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
some people get redness , swelling or itching around the area of the insulin injection .
this usually clears up in anything from a few days to a few weeks .
if this happens to you , tell your doctor .

how TO USE HUMALOG MIX25 KWIKPEN
always check the pack and the label of the pre-filled pen for the name and type of the insulin when you get it from your pharmacy .
make sure you get the Humalog Mix25 KwikPen that your doctor has told you to use .
always use Humalog Mix25 KwikPen exactly as your doctor has told you .
you should check with your doctor if you are not sure .
dosage You should normally inject Humalog Mix25 within 15 minutes of a meal .

but your doctor will have told you exactly how much to use , when to use it , and how often .
these instructions are only for you .
follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly . if you change the type of insulin you use ( for example from a human or animal insulin to a Humalog product ) , you may have to take more or less than before .
this might just be for the first injection or it may be a gradual change over several weeks or months .
you should not administer it using a different administration route .
under no circumstances should Humalog Mix25 be given intravenously .
preparing Humalog Mix25 KwikPen The KwikPen should be rotated in the palms of the hands ten times and inverted 180 ten times immediately before use to resuspend insulin until it appears uniformly cloudy or milky .

cartridges contain a small glass bead to assist mixing .
do not shake vigorously as this may cause frothing which may interfere with the correct measurement of the dose .
the cartridges should be examined frequently and should not be used if clumps of material are present or if solid white particles stick to the bottom or wall of the cartridge , giving it a frosted appearance .
check each time you inject yourself .
please follow the instructions carefully .
( needles are not included ) . prime your KwikPen before each use .
this checks that insulin comes out and clears the air bubbles from your KwikPen .
there may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these are harmless .
but if the air bubbles are too large it may affect the insulin dose .
injecting Humalog Mix25 Before you make an injection , clean your skin as you have been instructed .
inject under the skin , as you were taught .
do not inject directly into a vein .
after your injection , leave the needle in the skin for five seconds to make sure you have taken the whole dose .

after injecting As soon as you have done the injection , unscrew the needle from the KwikPen using the outer needle cap .
this will keep the insulin sterile and stop it leaking .
it also stops air entering the pen and your needle clogging .
do not share your needles .
do not share your pen .
replace the cap on the pen .
further injections Every time you use a KwikPen you must use a new needle .
before every injection , clear any air bubbles .
you can see how much insulin is left by holding the KwikPen with the needle pointing down .
the scale on the cartridge shows about how many units you have left . do not mix any other insulin in your disposable pen .
once the KwikPen is empty , do not use it again .
please get rid of it carefully - your pharmacist or diabetes nurse will tell you how to do this .
if you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need If you take more Humalog Mix25 than you need , a low blood sugar may occur .
check your blood sugar .
if your blood sugar is low , eat glucose tablets , sugar or drink a sugary drink .
then eat fruit , biscuits , or a sandwich , as your doctor has advised you and have some rest .
this will often get you over mild hypoglycaemia or a minor insulin overdose .
if you get worse and your breathing is shallow and your skin gets pale , tell your doctor at once .
a glucagon injection can treat quite severe hypoglycaemia .
eat glucose or sugar after the glucagon injection .
if you do not respond to glucagon , you will have to go to hospital .
ask your doctor to tell you about glucagon .
if you forget to use Humalog Mix25 If you take less Humalog Mix25 than you need , a high blood sugar may occur .
